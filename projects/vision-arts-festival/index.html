<p>The Vision Arts Festival held is held annually in Crans Montana, Switzerland and aims to bring art to the concrete walls, public places and structures of the village and ski buildings, transforming the mundane to the marvellous.</p>
<p>The festival is one of a kind. Think street art meets the mountains. The festival brings artists from different genres together to transform some dull and lifeless concrete walls and municipal buildings into works of art. As well as in the village, art can be found out in the mountains on tunnels, walkways and ski buildings. </p>

<p>Leon Kerr is a 3D street artist and had the difficult job of painting on the market square floor during market day. Keeping people off his wet paint and dealing with the scorching sun must have been challenging.</p>

<p>Nicolas Bamert chose to paint one of the out of town communal buildings hidden away between trees. The water works or 'Station de Traitement des Eaux' was a dull green, functional building, with ugly pipes and metal doors. Nicolas and his assistant worked in the blazing sun and heat to transform the building into something spectacular. He chose a bright colour scheme that hints at the use of the building and named the work 'Water Paradise'</p>
