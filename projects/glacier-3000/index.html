	<p>At the top of the Col du Pillon is a large car park with a cable car that takes you high above the village of Les Diablerets to the Tsanfleuron Glacier with a dome at 3000m.</p>
	<p>Col du Pillon connects the Vaud and Bern cantons of Switzerland and is the boundary between the French and German-speaking Swiss. With Gstaad at one end and Les Diablerets at the other, the col peaks at 1546m and is cleared of snow in the winter for access to the cable car. </p>

	<p>After paying a princely sum, the large cable car takes you up to the Scex Rouge peak at 2971m where a selection of man-made adventure awaits. First up is a large building housing the cable car, a restaurant and a viewing platform. From here you can take the Peak Walk by Tissot &#8212; the world’s first suspension footbridge spanning two summits, which takes you out to the Scex Rouge peak.</p>
	<p>A ski lift takes you down to the glacier or you can try the Alpine Coaster, a toboggan run down a metal track. Once at the bottom you can try the dog sleds, a snow bus or a helicopter flight. For those looking to experience something where you have to propel yourself, there is of course skiing, snowboarding and hiking on the glacier. There is also a watch shop - Tissot of course. Not all of these are available year-round.</p>

	<p>The Tsanfleuron glacier isn't actually at 3000m, nor is the Diablerets glacier across the way but the marketing of all these amusements is key - and at 65 Swiss Francs for a ticket to the top per person, people want more than a view these days it seems. </p>
	<p>A trip to Glacier 3000 is probably worthwhile in the winter when combined with winter sports but less thrilling in the summer. It makes for an unusual trip out on a hot summer day, and of course, the views are great but it does seem like an unnecessary amount of buildings and metalwork on what is supposed to be a natural area.</p>
