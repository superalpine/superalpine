    <h1>Monaco</h1>
    <h2>The densely packed principality on the Côte d'Azur</h2>

<p>Monaco’s 36,686 residents make it one of the most densely populated countries in the world, but only 9000 of them are original citizens or <i>Monégasques</i>. The rest mostly reside in the tiny principality for upto six months of the year to comply with residency laws and to make use of the personal tax benefits and lack of inheritance tax. In order to get those benefits they will have deposited at least half a million euros in a Monaco bank and rented or bought some of the most expensive property in the world. It’s no surprise that one in three of Monaco’s residents are millionaires, and more than a few billionaires call it home.</p>
<p>The development on this small piece of land between the sea and the Alps is dense but clever. To get its citizens up and down the precipitous principality, the streets are riddled with hidden lifts, stairs and escalators that are outside, not in. Tunnels connect many of the principality’s wards, travelled by vehicle or by foot.</p>
<p>On the surface, Monaco is a noisy, busy place, but you can find solitude and even peace. It has three major green areas: the Japanese Garden (Jardin Japonais) with its amazing sea views; the Jardin Exotique which looks down on the principality from an outcrop; and Jardin Saint-Martin on Le Rocher. There are many other smaller parks, but they’re mostly in the residential areas above Larvotto where it’s quieter. Some of these areas remain quiet all year as the tourists rarely stray from the coastal area.</p>

<h3>Oceanographic Museum of Monaco</h3>
<p>The museum sits on the west side of Le Rocher, the crown in the principality. Founded by Prince Albert I in 1906, it's well known for its association with legendary undersea explorer Jacques Cousteau, who was its director from 1957 to 1988. A stunning piece of architecture built from limestone originating from La Turbie in the mountains above Monaco, the museum took 11 years to complete and appears to rise from the sea, forming part of the cliffs. It sits in the Saint-Martin Gardens, offering beautiful views over the sea.
The museum often plays host to exhibitions by well-known artists, with two main floors of often-changing displays and a rooftop café. The basement is home to aquariums of different sizes housing a varied selection of marine life from jellyfish to small sharks.</p>
