	<h1>Chamonix</h1>
	<h2>Still the Death Sport Capital of the World?</h2>
</div>

<article>
<p>In a article for Gravity back in the late 90's, Mark Twight wrote a piece called 'Chamonix: Over the top or under the ground', in which he opened the piece with:</p>

<blockquote>The sign reads "World Capital of Skiing and Alpinism." I call it the "Death Sport Capital of the World."<cite>Mark Twight</cite></blockquote>

<p>Things have changed considerably since the 90's and may have even gotten more deadly. Twight was refering to Chamonix's climbing and skiing fatalities but progress never stands still and more dangerous sports like base jumping and proximity flying have been invented. With ever increasing amounts of people in the mountains and the climate melting the permafrost, the death toll may have increased.</p>
<p>On the ascent of Mont Blanc by the Go√ªter route there is the death couloir (of course there is) where on average 4 people a year are killed by rock falls. Researchers have found there to be rock falls here on average about every 25 minutes. The increased instability of many of the rock faces in the valley thanks to more extreme of heat means that rock fall is more common than ever.</p>
<p>Back in the 90's Twight wrote:</p>
<blockquote class="smaller">In Chamonix men achieve great things, and the Nietzschean ethic of surpassing one's previous best efforts plays out every day. As with all geographic sites of power, young people make the pilgrimage to measure themselves against the place and its people. Some commune with the mountain god and find their true selves among the ice and the stone. Others get slapped down and end up in the ground.<cite>Mark Twight</cite></blockquote>
<p>Today, aswell as people looking for a challenge you have an increase in people looking for a photo or video.</p>

<blockquote class="smaller">The cemeteries in Chamonix and Argentiere are beautiful. Rough-hewn monuments thrust through the earth like the mountains looming hungrily above them. They aren't homogeneous or polished like American tombstones or, for that matter, American lives. The carved stone speaks of great history.</blockquote>

<blockquote class="smaller">In many visits to deceased friends I never realized how young most of the people lying beneath those stones were. Many of the interred were buried well before the end of their third decade. I met a grieving Swede whose daughter had been killed by an avalanche while skiing for Chamonix's other god, the camera. "In Sweden, he said, "you rarely see a headstone for someone under 40. What kind of sick place is this?"</blockquote>
