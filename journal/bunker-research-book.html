      <p>Lurking amongst the many unfinished Super Alpine articles, I have been working on a piece about the Col de Petit St Bernard - researching the Fort high above the pass road when I came across the Little Maginot Line or Alpine Line.</p>
      
      <p>The French built a line of fortifications down the country and across the Alps to defend against invading armies, some of these bunkers I've seen on our travels across the Alps but they never registered until I looked into the Fort on the Petit St Bernard.</p>
      <p>These rather remarkable bunkers and forts often appear on the alpine passes and many are found in the Alpes-Maritimes region. I am now kicking myself for not thinking more about this while writing Issue Two of the magazine. </p>

      <p>Thanks to the power of suggestion (or perhaps Facebooks invasive tracking) Instagram showed me an #ad for this book. I bought it there and then. </p>
     
      <p>The rise of the independent publisher is something we are obviously grateful for, and super niche books like this are its forte. Written by Max Leonard, well known for his cycling books, and photographed by Camille McMillan, this is a fascinating look at how these fortified buildings found their way into some of the most remote, beautiful and 'unspoilt' landscapes of the Alps.</p>
      


      <p>In a print designers dream of paper stocks, cover flaps and hand-drawn illustrations 'Bunker Research' second edition expands on the limited-run first copy. Mainly photographic but with a section dedicated to explaining the method behind their inception and use or not -  Max Leonard goes into their construction and how in today's Alps they sit malevolently watching out from their often remote locations.</p>
      <p>The book looks at the ouverages (as they are known) in the 'Secteur Fortifie Alpes Maritimes' (SFAM) where some did see action during WWII along with some which were part of the Italians defensive line, the 'Vallo Alpino' before the border change and they now sit abandoned on the French side.</p>

       <p>It seems nobody knows what to do with these bunkers. You can't dig them out or blow them up of course. They sit as a reminder to a time when Europe was fighting within its borders and trench warfare was still a thing. Some are large with multiple levels all hidden beneath the surface, designed for 100's of men and artillery and some are just for a few with machine guns. Many men spent months in these sunken structures but only a few saw action and as they were made to be attacked their reinforced concrete structures are barely touched.</p>
     
      <p>Nature is slowly taking them back, but they will always be part of the landscape, a landscape we now look on as wild but has always been fought over.</p>
      <p>This is a fascinating book on a subject you are unlikely to read about elsewhere, especially if you don't speak French. Lovingly put together it's not going to be everyone's 'Tasse de Th√©' but isn't it great someone is making this stuff.</p>
