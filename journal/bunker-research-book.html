      <p>I'd been working on an article about the Col de Petit St Bernard - researching the Fort high above the pass road when I came across the Little Maginot Line or Alpine Line.</p>
      <p>The French built a line of fortifications to defend against invading armies at strategic points down their borders and named it after Andr√© Maginot, who came up with the idea. Where this met Italy and the Alps, it became known as the Alpine line.</p>
      <p>These ouvrages (works) consisted of bunkers and forts and often appear on the alpine passes due to there ideal location to defend against invaders. Like us, you may have seen one but may not have realized their history, complicated nature and their underground expanse.</p>

      <p>Thanks to the power of suggestion (or perhaps Facebooks invasive tracking) Instagram showed me an #ad for 'Bunker Research'. I bought it there and then. </p>

      <p>The rise of the independent publisher is something we are invested in and such a niche subject is its forte. Written by Max Leonard, well known for his cycling books, and photographed by Camille McMillan, this is a fascinating look at how these fortified buildings found their way into some of the most remote, beautiful and 'unspoilt' landscapes of the Alps.</p>
      <p>In a print designers dream of paper stocks, cover flaps and hand-drawn illustrations Bunker Research (second edition) expands on the limited-run first copy. Mainly photographic but with a section dedicated to explaining the method behind their inception and use -  Max Leonard goes into their construction and how in today's Alps they sit malevolently watching out from their often remote locations.</p>
      <p>Many of the fortifications never saw any action but some in the  'Secteur Fortifie Alpes Maritimes' (SFAM) were active during WWII and this is where the book concentrates. It's not only the French side that have these bunker systems, the Italians also had a defensive line, the 'Vallo Alpino'. After WWII the border changed and many now sit abandoned on the French side.</p>

       <p>Today it seems nobody knows what to do with these sunken structures. You can't dig them out or blow them up of course, although the Germans tried. They sit as a reminder to a time when Europe was fighting within its borders and trench warfare was still a thing. Some are large with multiple levels all hidden beneath the surface, where many 100's of men and artillery spent months and some are just for a few soldiers with machine guns. </p>
       <p>Nature is slowly taking them back, but they will always be part of the landscape, a landscape we now look on as wild but that has always been fought over.</p>
      <p>I find the marker of a good book is whilst reading I am taking notes to look up later or seeing ideas I might want to research more. This is one of those books. Fascinating, beautifully constructed and on a subject you are unlikely to read about elsewhere, Bunker Research is niche at its best.</p>
