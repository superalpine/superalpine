  <h3>Back on the road</h3>
  <h6>October 2021</h6>
  <p>After a two year break thanks to a global pandemic and some bad timing, we finally made it back to the Alps. The new reality of border crossings, getting your passport stamped in and out of Europe and of course, vaccine passports, attestations of health and testing, all made this the most difficult trip we have ever taken.</p>
  <p> Travelling to three alpine countries in September and October we have been working on Issue Three of the magazine (again) after abandoning the previous attempt. Look for the new issue this November. Hopefully. We also got to enjoy some spectacular autumn weather and clean alpine air before working on another exciting non-print project - more of that later.</p>
