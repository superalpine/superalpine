	<p>The Aiguille du Dru (also the Dru or the Drus; French, Les Drus) is a mountain in the Mont Blanc massif in the French Alps. It is situated to the east of the village of Les Praz in the Chamonix valley.</p>
	<p>The highest summit is the Grande Aiguille du Dru (or the Grand Dru) at 3,754 metres and slightly lower is the Petite Aiguille du Dru (or the Petit Dru) 3,733 metres. The two summits are on the west ridge of the Aiguille Verte (4,122 metres) and are connected to each other by the Brèche du Dru (3,697 metres). The north face of the Petit Dru is considered one of the six great north faces of the Alps. The southwest "Bonatti" pillar and its eponymous climbing route were destroyed in a 2005 rock fall</p>
