<h3>History</h3>
<p>James Bond was created in 1952 by the author Ian Fleming for the novel <i>Casino Royale</i>. Fleming was born in 1908 and was educated at Eton and Sandhurst in the UK before going to Austria to attend the Tennerhof School in Kitzb√ºhel, Munich University in Germany and the University of Geneva in Switzerland. This time spent in the Alps gave him a love for the mountains and made him an accomplished skier.</p>
<p>Fleming joined the Royal Navy shortly before the Second World War and worked for the Naval Intelligence Division (NID) where he had oversight of two intelligence units - 30 Assault Unit and T-Force. Fleming's time in NID was the inspiration for ten James Bond novels and a series of short stories. Two of his novels were made into films before Fleming died, aged 56.</p>
