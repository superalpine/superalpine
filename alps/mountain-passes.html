  <p>The Alps are home to numerous mountain passes that have played a crucial role in transportation and trade throughout history. These passes were vital for trade, migration, and military movements. During the Roman era, they facilitated commerce and cultural exchange. Later, they served as strategic routes for armies, including Napoleon’s forces. Today, these passes continue to play a crucial role in transportation, connecting regions and countries. Today they attract tourists, hikers, and cyclists, offering breathtaking views and a glimpse into the past. </p>
<p>The highest road pass in the Alps is the Col de l'Iseran at 2764 metres. Other passes have higher altitudes but lead to nowhere or are dead ends. This also makes the Iseran the highest pass in France. In Italy the Passo dell Stelvio at 2758 metres is the highest. In Austria the Großglockner Hochalpenstraße is the highest at 2504 metres but it's a toll road. In Switzerland the Umbrail pass at 2501 metres is the highest.</p>
