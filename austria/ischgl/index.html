<p>Well know for it's winter sports and extensive network of slopes, including the famous Silvretta Arena, it gained notoriety during the pandemic as a significant COVID-19 hotspot.</p>
<p>Ischgl also boasts a vibrant après-ski scene, with lively bars, clubs, and restaurants that create a buzzing atmosphere. In the summer months, Ischgl transforms into a less visited and quieter village.</p>
<p>In early 2020, the village became associated with a large cluster of infections that were linked to après-ski activities and nightlife establishments. The outbreak in Ischgl also led to a broader discussion about the responsibility of authorities and the tourism industry in managing public health risks during a pandemic.</p>
