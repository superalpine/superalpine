        <h2>007 Elements</h2>
        <h3>Sölden</h3>
        <p>One of the spectacular sets for the Bond film Spectre was the Gaislachkogl Mountain in Sölden, Austria. The Hoffler Klinik where James Bond meets Dr Madeleine Swann and the following chase sequence was filmed here. The Klinik was based on the Ice Q restaurant with some physical and digital alterations. Next to this is the 007 Elements installation that focuses on Spectre but features other titles in the long-running franchise, guiding visitors through a series of interactive galleries based on the films. Spectacular inside and outside this is a must for Bond fans and a bonus for skiers using the many pistes that start here.</p>

        <h3>Andermatt</h3>

The Furka, Grimsel and Susten passes take you on a journey through the heart of Switzerland with spectacular views all the way around. Follow Goldfinger and James Bond over the Furka and passed the abandoned Hotel Belvédère, marvelling at the dam on the Grimsel and the Steinen Glacier on the Susten. If this wasn't enough the St Gotthard pass to Italy is on the other side of Andermatt.</p>

        <h2>HR Giger Museum</h2>
        <h3>Gruyeres</h3>
        <p>The medieval village of Gruyères is an unexpected location for Swiss surrealist painter, sculptor and set designer Hans Ruedi Giger Castle which now houses the Museum. It's a permanent repository to many of Giger's key works, his private art collection and a gallery where Giger curated the works of other artists work. The work is often terrifying and sexually graphic and a calming drink can be taken afterwards at the Giger Bar opposite.</p>

        <h2>Eagles Nest</h2>
        <h3>Berchtesgaden</h3>
        <p>The 'Kehlsteinhaus' is situated on the top of the Kehlstein mountain overlooking the small town of Berchtesgaden and was designed by Martin Bormann for Adolf Hitlers 50th birthday. The name 'Eagle’s Nest' was adopted by the Allies who occupied it after the war. It was given back to the German government in 1960 along with the problem of what to do with it. It's not the only Nazi remnant nearby; tunnels, bunkers and the remains of SS barracks litter the countryside around it. A strange place lacking in the sombre atmosphere you would expect.</p>
