      <h2>Chamonix Mont-Blanc</h2>
      <h3>France</h3>
      <p>Home to Europes highest peak and the capital of alpine mountain sports, Chamonix is a must-stop on any tour. With an authentic atmosphere of a working town, Chamonix manages to mix winter chic and budget ski with something for every budget. Take the lift to the Aiguille du Midi with its amazing three countries view or the train to Montenvers and the 'Sea of Ice' glacier. Tour the Alpine Museum, hike the Tour du Mont Blanc, enjoy a sandwich or Michelin starred meal, the variety of what's on offer is why Chamonix is the top spot to destinations in the Alps.</p>

        <h2>Zermatt</h2>
        <h3>Switzerland</h3>
        <p>Zermatt is synonymous with the Matterhorn that overlooks the village and if you want a picture-postcard village - Zermatt beats Chamonix hands down. Zermatt is a car-free resort that is only accessible by train from the transit village of Tasch but otherwise offers a similar experience. You can take the lift to Theodul Glacier or a train to Gornergrat. You can visit the Matterhorn Museum, enjoy miles of skiing and hiking and eat out in style or at McDonald's. As with most of Switzerland though everything is a bit more managed and a lot more expensive. </p>

With a short but steep climb from the beach to the border, Monaco offers a luxurious amount of everything from Formula One racing to Hotels to shopping. It also has a surprising amount of green space if you look for it.</p>

        <h2>Montreux</h2>
        <h3>Switzerland</h3>

The Vaud Alps rise above the terraces giving Montreux its mild microclimate and 'Swiss Riviera' vibe. Known for its annual Jazz Festival, lakeside promenade and grand Belle Époque buildings, Montreux is a cosmopolitan mix of Swiss efficiency and touristic chaos. Steamboats ply their trade on the lake while the promenade is always busy with people. Behind the lakefront, you can find a mixture of shops selling everything from Swiss army knives to high fashion. The ubiquitous train station has a line to Rochers de Naye with its amazing views of the lake.</p>

        <h3>Switzerland</h3>
        <p>Perched on a hilltop in the Swiss canton of Fribourg is the medieval village of Gruyères - a place that gives its name to the famous Gruyère cheese.

The medieval buildings are now shops and tourist attractions and cafes that spill out onto the cobbled streets. Gruyères features a selection of museums, from Aliens to Tibetans to a more expected chateau tour. And cheese of course.</p>
