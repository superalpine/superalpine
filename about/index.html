<h1>About</h1>
<p>Super Alpine is a project founded in Chamonix, France in 2015 by Andrew and Julia Revitt with the mission of celebrating and promoting the rich cultural traditions and activities of the Alps. Through our digital platform and printed magazine, we aim to provide a comprehensive source of information and inspiration for those seeking to experience the unique beauty and diversity of the region.</p>
<p>The Alps are more than just a playground for outdoor enthusiasts. They are also home to a diverse array of cultures, each with its own unique traditions and customs. On our website and in our magazines and books, you can discover the history and culture of the Alps through our stories and photography.</p>
<p>We strive to offer authentic, engaging content that showcases the cultures of the Alps in a way that is informative, entertaining, and inspiring. We hope to be a valuable resource for anyone interested in the Alps.</p>
<p>We believe that by sharing our stories and experiences of the Alps, we can foster a greater appreciation and understanding of this stunning region and the people who call it home.</p>
