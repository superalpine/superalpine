<h1>About</h1>
<p><b>Super Alpine</b> is a project founded in <a href="../chamonix-travel-guide/index.html">Chamonix</a>, France in 2015 by Andrew and Julia Revitt with the mission of celebrating and promoting the rich cultural traditions and activities of the Alps. Through our digital platforms and printed <a href="../magazine/index.html">magazines</a>, we aim to provide a comprehensive source of information and inspiration for those seeking to experience the unique beauty and diversity of the region.</p>
<p>The Alps are more than just a playground for outdoor enthusiasts. They are also home to a diverse array of cultures, each with its own unique traditions and customs.
