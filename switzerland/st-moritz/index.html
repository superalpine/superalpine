<p>St. Moritz is a picturesque town in Graubünden, renowned for luxury hotels and prestigious winter sports events. St. Moritz has hosted the Winter Olympics twice, in 1928 and 1948, and is home to the most famous bobsleigh, the Cresta Run.
St. Moritz is also well known for its mineral springs, dating back an unbelievable 3000 years. Its popularity with tourists started in the 19th century when hotelier Johannes Badrutt bet a group of British tourists that they would enjoy St. Moritz in the winter just as much as they did in the summer. He offered to pay their travel expenses if they didn't enjoy themselves. The tourists took him up on his offer and ended up coming back for many years.</p>
<p>The hotel later became Badrutt's Palace, one of the most iconic landmarks in St. Moritz and is considered one of the world's leading luxury hotels. The hotel's architecture is grand and impressive, featuring a mixture of traditional and modern design elements. The interior is opulent, with luxurious furnishings, fine art, and stunning mountain views.
St. Moritz sits on the shores of Lake St Moritz and is made up of 5 distinct areas. Dorf is the historic centre of St. Moritz and the main commercial area of the town. It is known for its luxury shops, high-end restaurants, and hotels, including the famous Badrutt's Palace.</p>
<p>St. Moritz-Bad is located on the other side of the lake from Dorf and is home to several luxury hotels and a spa centre, as well as a sports complex. Champfèr is a quiet, residential area located just a few minutes outside of Dorf and known for its beautiful alpine scenery, hiking trails, and cross-country ski routes. Suvretta is situated on a hill overlooking the town. Suvretta is known for its mountain views and luxury hotels, including the Suvretta House. Celerina is a small village located just a few kilometres outside of St. Moritz. Celerina is a popular destination for families and is known for its family-friendly activities. </p>
