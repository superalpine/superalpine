<p>Davos is located in the canton of Graub√ºnden in eastern Switzerland and is a popular destination for winter sports enthusiasts. The town is also known for hosting the annual World Economic Forum (WEF) meeting, where political and business leaders gather to discuss global economic and social issues. The WEF meeting in Davos is often referred to simply as "Davos" and has been taking place since 1971.</p>
<p>Davos in the late 13th century was a small farming community and wasn't until the 19th century that it began to attract visitors who were interested in the health benefits of its mountain air and pristine environment. Many of these early visitors suffered from tuberculosis, and they believed that fresh mountain air could help cure the disease.</p>
<p>The opening of a sanatorium in Davos in 1867 helped to cement its reputation as a health resort. Over the years, many famous figures visited Davos to recuperate from various illnesses, including Robert Louis Stevenson, who wrote his famous book "Treasure Island" while staying in Davos.</p>
<p>In the early 20th century, Davos began to develop as a ski resort. The first ski lift was installed in 1934, and the town's reputation as a winter sports destination grew rapidly.</p>
<p>Davos has a population of over 10,000 people, making it the highest permanent town in the Alps at 1560 metres in altitude. It has a sprawling urban layout from the lake in the north at Davos Wolfgang, to the main town of Davos Dorf with its hotels and shops to Davos Platz in the south with the railway station.</p>
