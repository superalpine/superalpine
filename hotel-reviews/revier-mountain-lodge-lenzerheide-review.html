<p>The Revier Mountain Lodge in Lenzerheide, Switzerland is Instagram-friendly and ideal for the ski lift next door.</p>
<p>We were fascinated enough by the Revier Mountain Lodge to overlook the hotel luxuries (even basics) and try this unusual place. The Revier is very Instagram-friendly because of the view from the room. Ideal for posing in front of the enormous windows. Revier has no lobby, no reception and nothing in the rooms other than a bed and a bathroom. Doesn't sound that appealing, does it?</p>
<p>Booking is done online and when you arrive you get your room code from a machine at the entrance, next to a bar and restaurant. This was straightforward enough and we took the lift up to the top floor for our XL Cabin. The entrance to the cabin was via a keycode - not ideal as you had to remember it or write it down and the buttons were less than positive to the touch - what would happen if you locked yourself out.</p>
<p>At 23m<sup>2</sup> it isn't too small, mainly because there is nothing much in it - not even a door on the shelves. The room has a double bed and a basic bathroom with a shower. Free WIFI and an HD TV are the only things provided. The main attraction is the panoramic window which stretches the full width of the room and the window seat in front of it. When we arrived on a warm day in August, the room was very hot as the panoramic window only has a small opening. Not a problem in winter.</p>
<p>The bed was comfy, the bathroom was fine and the view was fantastic. We woke to watch the sunrise from the bed and the window seat.</p>
<p>We ate in the restaurant on the ground floor for both our evening meal and breakfast - both were reasonably good and well-priced. The Revier Mountain Lodge was fine for one night but I wouldn't want to stay any longer. It is ideal for the budget skier, snowboarder or mountain biker who is out all day. The price wasn't sufficiently different from hotels with facilities to warrant another stay or if you aren't the target audience.</p>
