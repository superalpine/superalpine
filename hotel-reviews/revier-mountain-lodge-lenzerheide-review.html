<h3>Review</h3>
<p>We visited the Revier Mountain Lodge in August 2022.</p>
<p>We were fascinated enough by the Revier Mountain Lodge to overlook the normal hotel luxuries and try this unusual place. You see the Revier is very Instagram friendly because of the view from the room. Ideal for posing in front of the enourmous windows. Although we didn't do this - it did look great. Revier has no lobby, no reception, no food, not really anything other than a bed with bathroom. Doesn't sould that appealing really does it?</p>
<p>Booking is done online and when you arrive you get your keycard from a machine in the entrance next to a bar and restaurant. This was straightforward enough and we took the lift up to the top floor for our XL Cabin. At 23m<sup>2</sup> it isn't too small, mainly because there is nothing much in it. Not even a door on the shelves. The room has a double bed as well as a panorama sofa that can be converted into an additional single bed and a basic bathroom with shower. Free WIFI and a huge HD TV are the only things provided and of course the huge panoramic window.</p>
<p>Entrance to the room was via a keycode - not ideal as you had to remember it or write it down and the buttons were less than positive to the touch, not sure what would happen if you locked yourself out as there was no one on site...</p>
<p>The bed was comfy, the bathroom was fine and the view was fantastic. We woke to watch the sunrise.</p>
<p>We ate in the restaurant on the ground floor for both our evening meal and breakfast, both were reasonably good and well priced.</p>


<p>It was fine for one night but I wouldn't want to stay any longer - when we arrived it was very hot in the room as you can only open a small part of the enourmous window.</p>
<p><b>Pros</b>: The view for sunrise, comfy bed</p>
<p><b>Cons</b>: No facilities - not even drinking water, door code, no staff, overpriced</p>
