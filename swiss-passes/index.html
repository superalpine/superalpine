  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <em>Swiss Passes - A grand tour from Gstaad to Davos</em>
  <p>It was a mountain pass that brought together the communities that became Switzerland. The Saint Gotthard pass was created in 1220 and the lucrative trade with the Mediterranean that came from it saw the local farmers join together to take advantage of this deal. In August 1291 the first three cantons joined together to form the Helvetic Confederation - the official name of Switzerland. Thanks to the joining of the people from the valleys, Switzerland is one of the most diverse countries in Europe. Today the 26 cantons that makeup Switzerland are home to over 90 road passes, 50 of which are over 1200m in elevation - this is in addition to the many trail and rail passes. </p>

  <p>Crossing the Alps used to be a life-threatening struggle against nature but over the years the Alps became increasingly easier to transit thanks in part to conquering armies such as Napoleonâ€™s, who brought trails, tracks and later roads. All of today's passes have a hard surface with the Umbrail being the last to be fully surfaced in 2015. </p>
  <p>Many of the higher road passes have a rail or tunnel alternative and many others feature road covers to limit disruption by snow. The summits of today's passes are remnants of the past, with hostels used by ancient travellers becoming abandoned or converted into trinket shops or museums.</p>
