<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Mountain passes come in all shapes and sizes and have been traversed by all possible means. Crossing the Alps used to be an epic struggle against nature, often with loss of life, but over the years the Alps became increasingly easier to traverse thanks in part to conquering armies such as Napoleon’s who brought with them trails, tracks and later roads.</p>

<p>At the heart of the Alps, Switzerland is one of the most diverse countries in Europe thanks to its formation of people from different valleys, speaking different languages with different cultures. It was a mountain pass that brought together the communities that became Switzerland. The Saint Gotthard pass was created in 1220 and the lucrative trade with the mediterranean that came from it saw the local farmers join together to exploit this opportunity. It was in August 1291 that the first three cantons joined together and the Helvetic Confederation (still the official name of Switzerland) was formed. </p>

<p>Today the 26 cantons that make up Switzerland are home to over 90 road passes, 50 of which are over 1200m in elevation - this in addition to the many trail and rail passes. Many of the higher road passes also have a rail or tunnel alternative and plenty of others feature road covers to limit disruption by snow. The higher sections of many of today's passes remain only as remnants of the past, with hostels used by ancient travellers becoming abandoned or converted into trinket shops or museums.</p>

<p>Many of the passes with strategic locations have hidden military installations, underground bunkers for planes and tank traps designed either to repel the Germans during the World Wars or the Russians during the cold war. Some of these installations are still in use today and others have been repurposed to such diverse activities such as museums, server farms and even giant safes.</p>

<p>In modern day Switzerland some of the passes are still used for trade but increasingly they are now only used for leisure and sport. Thankfully the challenge of getting from one valley to another, and from one country to another, is an ongoing fascination for some.</p>


<h3>Mountain passes</h3>

<p>Many of the passes are closed from late October to early June. This depends considerably on the snow conditions. Always check before travelling. Some passes can be traversed in winter with snow tyres but most, especially the higher ones are closed. If a tunnel exists the pass will be closed longer and later. If the snow still remains in late May the roads will be cleared and you can witness magnificent snow banks on either side of the road.</p>
<p>Avoid the passes on Swiss bank holidays and the height of summer, unless very early or late in the day. Give way to vehicles coming up the pass (see PostBus) and only use your horn on blind corners. Do not overtake on solid white lines. Some local drivers can be upset by overtaking as the Swiss generally do not overtake even where it is legal. Beware of other road users, especially near parking and summits. Cyclists, tourist buses and farm vehicles can be found going very slowly on passes. Dipped headlights are required in tunnels.</p>
<p>The maximum speed limit on most passes is 80km/h. The speed limit changes in tunnels, road works and in urban or summit areas to 60km/h or lower. Fixed speed cameras are generally not found on passes. Mobile speed traps are often found on the approach and exit of passes. The exits of tunnels are often used and Swiss Police conceal cameras and cars while operating speed checks. Speeding fines are issued from 1km/h over the speed limit upwards and grow to very severe when over 20km/h. Fines are on the spot. You can be banned on the spot, even if this means abandoning your vehicle in the middle of nowhere. Automatic speed cameras generate postal fines worldwide. Radar detectors are banned in Switzerland.</p>
<p>During the summer months many pass roads are being repaired so always expect roadworks.</p>

<h3>Borders</h3>

<p>As with any border crossing you should have your passport, driving licence, vehicle registration and insurance documents with you. Travel insurance that can get you out of every situation is also worth the investment. It isn’t advisable to carry high-value items without receipts or large amounts of cash across borders.</p>

<p>Borders tend not to be staffed on smaller roads and it is unlikely you will be stopped coming and going into Switzerland on the mountain passes. If you have an unusual or modified vehicle, travel in a group of similar vehicles or don’t have a vignette you are more likely to be stopped.</p>

<p>To drive on the motorways in Switzerland you will need a vignette. This is available at border crossings or online if you want to buy in advance. It is valid from 1 December of the previous year to 31 January of the following year. It should be fixed to the left side of your windscreen. </p>

<h3>PostBus</h3>
<p>The PostBus is easily identified from its yellow colour, markings and horn that plays the fictional William Tell’s overture. The PostBus always has priority and you will need to reverse out of its way if required. </p>

<h2>Col de Forclaz</h2>

<p>One of the more varied Alpine passes, Col de la Forclaz runs from Martigny to the Swiss/French border at Châtelard. The pass can thank Thomas Cook and his development of the first tours from England for its construction. Before the Col road was built, only mule traders and smugglers zigzagged up the mountain face over to what was later to become Valais and, even later, Switzerland. When Cook led his first tourists from England to Geneva and on to Chamonix, it was via the Forclaz that they entered the new federal state of Switzerland.</p>
<p>The first attempt at building a road started around 1827, but it wasn’t until 1920 that vehicles could use it. In those days it was closed at night, and during the day the speed limit was 18kph – now easily tripled on a cycling descent. Today the route is one of the few passes that are open all year round. On the odd occasion in winter when the road is closed, it’s generally because the Col des Montets on the French side is snowed in. This closure dictates a considerable detour via Geneva and the whole of Lake Geneva.</p>
<p>Back in 1999, the Forclaz was our first mountain pass experience, travelling to Saas-Fee for the Glacier bike race. We stopped on the descent for a picnic lunch while marvelling at the view of the Rhône valley from the Col’s slopes. In later years it became the main route from our home in Chamonix to the forbidden pleasures of Switzerland. Well, not really forbidden, just expensive. We were often in an underpowered car fully loaded with bikes on the way to some now outlawed Swiss single-track. The climb back up the Forclaz was a fight against gravity, through the vineyards then deep into the mountains via luxuriously smooth turns and the odd hairpin bend, ascending all the while.</p>
<p>The hairpins in the middle part of the climb offer outstanding views back into the canton of Valais, with parking in a couple of choice spots. The blue haze over the Rhône valley is a common sight. In season the apricot sellers are out in force in the parking places.</p>
<p>The top of the climb is reached by a long straight. At the summit, there is a cafe with the obligatory ‘Swiss’ knick-knacks (made in China) and some parking. The area is a very popular hiking spot, with trails crisscrossing the area. These trails are part of the Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc route as well as the Tour du Mont Blanc. This isn’t the best summit of the day, though.</p>
<p>The descent takes us through Trient, a place for hiking to the Trient glacier or for admiring the mountains that back on to Chamonix’s Balme ski area and the Mont Blanc range beyond that. And a pink church. After Trient the road becomes a fast descent, passing Tête-Noire and its ‘mysterious gorges’ through which Cook’s tourists had to climb. 
During the Second World War, the pass from Forclaz to Châtelard was heavily fortified with 15 bunkers, and both road and railway were also protected by mines. The surrounding area was littered with anti-tank barriers, known as the Toblerone line after the redoubtable Swiss chocolate (although it’s unclear which was modelled on which), to prevent the Germans from invading through France. Some of the defences remained in place during the Cold War, and the last were eventually decommissioned in 1989.</p>
<p>Signs to the Émosson dam via Finhaut appear on the right at the bottom of the descent. At this point, a diversion up to the dam is on our itinerary. </p>

<h2>Col du Grand Saint-Bernard</h2>
<p>We climb steeply northwards out of the bustling streets of Aosta back into the quiet mountains and towards the most famous of the transalpine routes, the Col du Grand Saint-Bernard, or Colle del Gran San Bernardo from the Italian side. For centuries, this was one of Europe’s most important and strategic transit points. When Augustus was planning the conquest of Britannia, he ordered the track to be widened, making it passable for carts, and so useful for the military and trade.</p>
<p>It was Bernard of Menthon in the eleventh century who came to the rescue of many a traveller by founding the hospice at the summit of the pass. It became a refuge for those accosted by bandits or battered by storms, and Bernard later became a saint and the road his namesake.</p>
<p>At 2,469 metres, the Col du Grand Saint-Bernard is the third-highest road in the Alps. The pass was replaced for most traffic by a toll tunnel in 1964, but the old pass road remains and can be accessed before the tunnel.</p>
<p>The old road is high and open only from June to September. Late in May the snowploughs are still at work near the top, creating snowbanks and clearing the road. Come October the snow will retake the pass, leaving the tunnel as the only link between the two countries.</p>
<p>Climbing towards the Col from Aosta, we almost miss the turnoff to the old pass road, the tunnel taking priority for most traffic. Look out for a slip road on the right before the main tunnel signs. Taking the pass road means you don’t get to cross the impressive 305-metre-long Dardanelli Viaduct. Famous for its appearance in the opening sequence of the film The Italian Job (1969), the viaduct was built to access the tunnel and opened in 1964, not long before the film’s release. In the film, Roger Beckermann and his Lamborghini Miura pass over the viaduct and up the Saint-Bernard in the most iconic of film scenes to feature a mountain pass. (That’s a bit odd, as he would have been coming from the tunnel, but it looks good in the movie.) The drive up the pass does mostly take place on the Saint-Bernard, but the part where Beckermann meets his doom in a tunnel was shot on the nearby SS26 road to La Thuile. The classic closing scenes of the film, featuring the bus hanging over the edge of the road, were shot on Colle del Nivolet in Italy.</p>
<p>We stop on the first hairpin of the newly resurfaced pass road to enjoy a look at it. The starting point for the ascent is the village of Saint Rhemy, the last inhabited place on this side of the pass. In bygone times the men of the village, the Marronniers, held the right to accompany travellers and provide safe passage over the pass. From here up the environment takes on a marked change; the road signs and buildings disappear and we are surrounded by trees and mountains. </p>
<p>The road is quiet and climbs relentlessly as Matt Monro’s ‘On Days Like These’ echoes in our heads. We get occasional glimpses of the tunnel road before it heads into the mountain, and we stop briefly at the head of a beautiful valley before crossing the tree line, where the landscape becomes dramatic. The open pastures are strewn with rocky structures such as the striking Tour des Fous, which, legend holds, was infested by the Saracens before the hospice was built at the summit of the pass. These towers of rock are all overlooked by the towering Aiguille des Sasses, 3015 metres high. We climb through a short tunnel, then a tight left bend resolves at the summit.</p>
<p>The Italian border outpost is nothing but an abandoned booth, but a modern Swiss one sits a short distance away. Today it is empty. We pull into a parking bay overlooking a glacial lake that is frozen 265 days of the year. Today its blue waters shimmer like an oversaturated Instagram photo with the definition set to max. The lake is surrounded by buildings and a few remnants of summer stalls. Behind us, a statue of St Bernard looks back down the Italian side. </p>
<p>The hospice and monastery are on the far side of the lake. The monastery houses a permanent community of monks, and serves as a spiritual centre and retreat for visitors. We can’t forget the St Bernard dog, unfortunately, which was bred here to rescue lost souls on the journey over the pass. If you like big, hairy dogs, you can still find them at the museum. The old tale of casks of brandy around their necks is a myth, but they did rescue many lost travellers, and one in particular, Barry I, became so famous that they had him stuffed and put in a museum. (The dog, not the traveller.) St Bernard escaped such a fate and went on to open another pass, the Col du Petit Saint-Bernard on the French/Italian border. Another worthy visit.</p>
<p>In May 1800 Napoleon’s army used the Col du Grand Saint-Bernard to enter Italy. He chose the shortest route but was still held up by snow and ice. The crossing was compared by writers at the time to Hannibal’s quest, leading to an iconic painting by Jacques-Louis David imaginatively titled Napoleon Crossing the Alps (1801). In it, Napoleon is pictured on a majestic white horse, which rears in defiance. In reality, he went over on a mule after a reconnaissance by one of his generals. The Swiss don’t much care for the story, since Napoleon requisitioned supplies (including 21,000 bottles of wine) and never paid them back. The Swiss, after all, do love their francs.</p>
<p>A cold wind picks up over the lake and we continue our journey, thanking Bernard for his sterling work. As we leave the summit, views of the Swiss mountains fill the windscreen. The Italian SS27 turns into the Swiss E21 and is immediately different from the Italian side. It’s vintage Swiss pass material with the road surrounded by rock-strewn pastures and mountains. Trails snake around the pass road leading two feet, two wheels or four hooves up and down the Swiss side. A series of mysterious towers appears at the side of the road, apparently providing ventilation for the tunnel below. The road tightens and the corners follow suit as we head down the short straights and endless, folding hairpin bends. </p>
<p>The tunnel exit appears on our right and the old pass road merges with the tunnel road. Those majestic views on the horizon are now interrupted by avalanche galleries, part tunnels designed to keep the snow off the road on the way to and from the tunnel. These make the new route usable 365 days a year. As we disappear undercover, glimpses of the large Lac des Toules reservoir come and go until we exit the gallery section.</p>
<p>The road descends on fast, sweeping bends, through small hamlets such as Bourg-Saint-Pierre and Liddes, dipping below the tree line. As the valley of Valais heads towards Sembrancher, it tightens to a pinch point, and there is the option of continuing on the faster E21 or diverting up to Champex Lac. Continuing to Martigny on the E21 is the quicker, wider route, but we are in no rush.</p>

<h2>Simplon Pass</h2>

<p>The Simplon pass stands high above Brig but is one of the easier traverses of the Alps thanks to rich men and Emperors.</p>
<p>The Simplon pass was originally a route for smugglers and mercenaries in the times before Valais was even part of Switzerland. It took a wealthy merchant, Kaspar Jodok von Stockalper to elevate its worth and ultimately his own. Stockalper's pass was just a mule track but still required his substantial wealth to build it. Today it is still available but as a two day hiking trail from Brig to Gondo. Some of the hostels he built still remain at Gondo. The old route also features a secret underground fortress built around 100 years ago with artillery designed to stop any enemy advances through the narrow valley of Gondo. Declassified in the 90s, tours of the facility are now available.

The pass as we know it today came about thanks to its lower altitude and better weather than the Saint-Bernard. This made it more appealing to Napoleon for the transportation of artillery. Opened in 1805, Napoleon never had the occasion to use it. Thanks to the ever warming climate the Simplon pass is now normally usable throughout the year and during times of snow, it's kept clear by ploughs, rarely being shut for more than a day.

Starting in Brig, home to Stockalper, the pass climbs on a dual carriageway to the splendid Ganter Bridge where it returns to a single carriageway. This pass is not the hairpin fesstoned tarmac we are used to, hence its popularity with lorries and short Emperors. The road is smooth without too steep a gradient and arrival at the summit is quick and efficient.

Once at the top a new utilitarian parking bay appears and nearby a eight-metre-high stone eagle erected during World War II by the 11th mountain brigade who kept watch on the pass. Just past the layby is a hospice commissioned by Napoleon and finished and run by the same canon as the Saint-Bernard passes. In its heyday it could accommodate 300 people and remains the largest hospice on any of the alpine passes. It still operates today with accommodation for up to 130 guests. Walking around the hospice the views are wide and spectacular. 

Just south of the summit is a beautiful alpine plateau with the Old Hospice (Alter Spittel), at its heart. Renovated during the 17th century by Stockalper, the hospice was supplanted by Napoleons. In the distance the Boshorn and Fletschorn peaks make this an outstanding view.

The descent into Italy is a classic Swiss contradiction of smooth, super fast roads, with open curves and good visibility but speed limits that mean you are braking all the way. You can leave the main main road and pick up some smaller roads until you reach the Gondo gorge and the valley narrows enough to make the Romans think it was impassable.

Gondo was the scene of a disaster in October 2000 when a mudslide swept through the village killing 13 people and destroying many of the buildings, damaging the Stockalper tower.The tower was laster reconstructed and is now a hotel and restaurant, offering some of the same services it provided to Stockalper's men.

The Simplon pass does not make the most exciting drives but a spectacular summit that welcomes all forms of transport, even in winter makes it worth a visit.</p>
</article>
<h2>Susten Pass</h2>

<p>Defined by wars and the military the Susten pass came to be one of the most modern of Switzerland's alpine passes.</p>

<p>Although the Susten pass was used for trade like many others, it was its use by the military in the 17th and 18th centuries and its strategic promise during the World Wars that helped its development. The initial pre-war plan was to develop a tourist itinerary for the upsurge in car driving but with the arrival of World War II, the advantage of having vehicular access for military purposes sold the deal. This unfortunate timing meant construction of the new road design took until the end of the war. Opened in 1946 the pass road runs parallel to the old mule track from Innertkirchen with Wassen and has many short tunnels where the mountains overrun the road. 

Climbers and boulderers will find what they are looking for on the Susten Pass, too. A host of different routes and boulders make for a varied athletic challenge.

The Stein glacier sits below the Sustenhorn on the approach to the summit and drains into the lake (Steinsee) visible from the road. In 1992 six people were killed by an explosion inside the ‘Steingletschers’ military underground storage, located on the slopes of the pass. The explosion of armaments registered a magnitude 3.7 on the Richter scale and caused part of the mountainside to slide. Large pieces of the facility were found over 600m away. The cause was a fire in one of the chambers. You can see why they were kept so far away from the populus.

Himmelrank. Those who built the Susten road named this hairpin bend "Paradise Bend": it offers a fine viewpoint over the verdant valley Gadmen, downhill, and over the icy summits of the Sustenhörner (Sustenhorn, Gwächtenhorn), upstream. 

The Susten pass was featured in the launch material for the limited edition Porsche 911R.

In August 2016 a F/A-18 from the nearby military airport in Meiringen crashed into the mountains on the Susten pass in bad weather, killing the pilot who failed to eject.</p>

<h2>Grimsel Pass </h2>

<p>One of the shorter passes, the Grimsel was fought over for years and finally lost the battle to an unexpected victor - hydroelectricity.

The Grimsel pass is the only road crossing between the cantons of Valais and Bern and was used as far back as the 14th century. Often used by warring parties before Switzerland’s cantons united into the republic it is today, the Grimsel passes original path was diverted by the installation of the hydroelectric power stations and dams that give it a unique pyloned look. The original route and hospice succumbed to progress in 1932 when the Grimsel lake and valley was expanded to create the first dam and hydroelectric plant. The original Grimsel lake now flooded the route and the pass had to be re-routed. 

Our journey to the Grimsel starts from back in the Valais surrounded by majestic vineyards and embroiled by the valley's sultry temperatures. We join the motorway at Sion but it soon stutters to a halt at Sierre, tries to start up again at Brig, and then gives up altogether as the valley closes in.

It’s a slow, torturous drive through a never-ending chalet sprawl common in Switzerland with no hint of the sign posted glaciers and peaks either side. Just as you leave one village the speed limit climbs, only to drop almost immediately as you arrive in another. In the high summer, the traffic is turgid and the anticipation of the high mountain passes becomes a desperate urge. 

The Rhône valley opens out after Fiesch and we break through the Chalet line around the same time as the tree line. On arrival at Gletsch, the village, which is more a junction for rail and road traffic, seems overwhelmed by the great passes surrounding it.

The Furka pass is visible straight ahead, the Grimsel pass takes a sharp left and heads straight up above us. This is where the driving starts in earnest. Waiting for a clear stretch is key to an entertaining drive. The Grimsel attracts its fair share of slower traffic, but the Furka seems to fare worse.

It’s a short, fast run up a few hairpins and straights to the Grimsel’s 2164m peak and almost a disappointment after the long drive. The top is a false peak, with its shops, cafe, car parks and lakes and almost worth missing for the ‘Hotel Grimsel Hospiz’  just over the top. But then you would miss some spectacular views back towards the Furka and of course Totensee. The ‘Lake of the Dead’ is named after a battle between the cantons in the Napoleonic wars - now the only battle is for parking.

As soon as you leave the car park the view down the other side into Canton Bern appears with great views over Grimselsee and the hotel. It’s probably best to stop here rather than the top for some peace and quiet and perhaps a bit of car or marmot spotting. 

The Hotel Grimsel sits proudly on a spit on Lake Grimselsee. This was built after the lake was dammed to replace the original hospice. We cross the cobblestone approach road and find an array of M sport cars parked at the bus stop and in the turning circle. The real car park is actually around the back but they time it right and escape before the PostBus arrives. Never mess with the PostBus.

It’s obvious from the view here that the Swiss love anything hydroelectric. A myriad of cables and dams criss-cross the scenery and progress is alway ongoing in Switzerland. The discovery of a large crack in the Spitallamm dam wall means that a new dam wall is being created. The new dam is scheduled to be completed by 2025 but until that time expect the Grimsel pass to look less than magnificent.

Once you’ve had your fill of views the descent down the valley is a fast one and without many distractions. Grimsel isn’t the most beautiful or rewarding of the passes and works best combined with the Furka and Susten.</p>


<h2>Furka Pass</h2>

<p>The Furka pass is one of the world's most iconic roads and was immortalised in the 1964 film Goldfinger. Much has changed since that time and it's unlikely the Swiss would take too kindly to Mr Bond and Ms Mastersons antics these days. Goldfinger would probably still get a pass through.</p>

<p>The Furka pass links the Ursern valley in canton Uri with Goms in canton Valais. Built in 1866 for strategic military reasons, it was the longest pass in Switzerland when it opened. Since then it has been used for Valaisans to emigrate and trade between cantons. Tourism on the Furka is also very popular thanks in part to Fleming’s creation. Both the Furka and Grimsel start in Gletsch and form two parts of a great alpine pass tour that is completed by the Susten pass. As it is we are heading to Andermatt and beyond so the trilogy won’t be on the cards today.

Starting in Gletsch we climb on a long straight road that a couple of hundred of years ago would have been covered by the Rhône glacier, that we can just about make out its presence in the distance. As we cross the river we start up the steep long hairpins and it becomes tempting to stop and look back down the valley but we push on to the iconic hotel. The Belvédère hotel is just below the summit and is probably one of the most photographed places on any pass. The hotel itself has been closed for a while. Possibly sold, possibly awaiting refurbishment, possibly never to open again, depending on your sources. 

The view back down to Gletsch is a treat for the eyes and it’s striking that the best views of the Furka are available from the top of the Grimsel pass across from where we stand. We park across the hairpin from the hotel and get an espresso at a small, incredibly slow cafe and souvenir shop. Not far from that is the start of the hike to the Rhône glacier and ‘Ice grotto’. 

Like most of the Alp’s glaciers, climate change is shrinking them at an alarming rate. Every summer scientists cover the glacier with great white covers to deflect the sun and vainly hope the receding can be slowed. Most don’t think it will be here in another century. Unsurprisingly the ‘Ice grotto’ has to be redone every year and you would think cutting a hole in a receding glacier with one hand while covering it up with another would be an easy fix but tourism I guess. Much like the death of Alpine pass hotels, the glaciers and even some of these passes will eventually be reclaimed by nature. 

A few minutes up the road from the hotel the real summit of the pass emerges and plateaus before the descent begins. It’s around this point you can play find the rock Tilly Masterson tries to shoot Auric Goldfinger from. Speaking of which, it would be remiss not to mention the film that makes an otherwise average Swiss pass stand out. Goldfinger was the third in the series of films, but the 7th in the novels. Written by Ian Fleming in 1959 and made as a film in 1964, it did make a passable attempt at the novel, unlike those that followed.

The Furka pass is famous for two parts of the film. James Bond chasing and ultimately derailing Tilly Mastersons Mustang in his Aston Martin DB5, when he was supposed to be surveilling Auric Goldfinger, and Tilly Masterson attempting to assassinate Goldfinger. Tilly being the sister of Jill Masterson, Goldfinger's secretary and the girl suffocated by gold paint in a scene so iconic in the movie. A later scene at a petrol station was filmed in Andermatt. The film played around with locations and most of the shooting was actually on the Realp side, other than the shot of Goldfingers Roll-Royce Silver Ghost leaving the Belvédère hairpin when the pass was still part gravel. Another location failure is when Bond is following Goldfinger along the pass his ‘Sat Nav’ thinks he is just outside of Geneva, on the lake road near Coppet, 4 hours away from the Furka.

The book differs greatly from the film - Bond follows Goldfinger down that well-driven route through France to the Alps and never goes anywhere near the Furka pass. Coincidently in the book, the shooting takes place in Coppet, where Bond of the film thinks he is. There is no car chase in the book but Bond does disable Masterson’s car, a Triumph, not the abomination in the film, with his Aston. A DB Mark III, not a DB5 - there was no DB5 at the time of the book.

Back to the present day and the breathtaking views at the summit await. Towards the east, the Ursern valley stretches before you to the Saint Gotthard massif. To the west, the 4000m peaks of canton Valais and the Bernese Alps dominate the view. The pass offers a host of possibilities for hiking, climbing and alpine flowers are found in abundance on its slopes.

Hidden on the Furka in an almost Bondian way is a series of secret military installations. Designed to defend the Furka against invasion in the 1880s and later the Nazi threat, these legacies still haunt the Alps. Overlooking the tourists at the Belvédère is Fort Galenhütten, a gun emplacement, brutal and obvious in its construction. From a distance, it appears like another rocky outcrop on the pasture. On the descent to Realp what looks like a classic Swiss stable with colourful doors and windows is, in fact, Fort Fuchsegg, a machine-gun bunker, with a well-executed camouflage of paint where no doors or windows exist, and cows are not welcome.

On the way down the road is much tighter and more twisting than the climb. The busy nature of the Furka reveals itself and traffic can be hellish, thanks to the PostBus, coaches, cyclists and all manner of slow, badly driven vehicles. Coaches especially can ruin a great drive. On the descent they are unable to negotiate many of the corners without crossing the line, hindering both those climbing and descending. A few times it did cross our minds that some of the Bond (of the films) gadgets to eliminate some of these obstructions would be in order.

Arriving at Realp and the valley floor, the road is almost straight to Andermatt. At which point you can turn off left to start the climb to the Susten pass.

The Furka pass is not the iconic place and drive that Sean Connery allegedly loved back in the '60s but it’s still worthy of a trip, especially as part of the trilogy. The Aston is optional.</p>

<h2>Nufenen Pass</h2>

<p>The high road through glaciers and avalanches<p>

<p>The Nufenen Pass is the second highest mountain pass in Switzerland and lies between the villages of Ulrichen in the canton of Valais and Airolo in Ticino. The pass is one of the newer roads and was opened to motor vehicle traffic in September 1969. Originally a mule track it has taken a long while to open up the Bedretto valley to the Rhone valley and its thanks once again the Swiss love of hydroelectricity. The Gries Dam was constructed to capture melt waters from snow and the Gries Glacier in 1966 and soon after the road was completed.

The 2478m of altitude and remote location of the Nufenen means avalanches are not uncommon and avalanche covers can be found on its slopes. It is one of the mountain passes frequently surrounded by snow walls and is one of the wilder of Switzerland's road building efforts. Once you reach the top, you can admire an unforgettable panoramic view over the snow- capped mountains. To the east of the top of the pass is the source of the Ticino River. Towards the north are views of the Bernese Alps, including the Finsteraarhorn, and a view over the Gries Glacier to the south. </p>

<h2>Saint Gotthard Pass</h2>

<p>Saint Gotthard spoiled the alps for choice with multiple ways of traversing the Gotthard massif.</p>
<p>The Saint Gotthard pass traverses the Saint-Gotthard Massif and connects northern and southern Switzerland. The pass runs from Andermatt in the German-speaking canton of Uri and Airolo in the Italian-speaking canton of Ticino. In 1882 a rail tunnel was opened and in 1980 a road tunnel - both were, at that time, the longest tunnels of their time. You might think that was enough but In 2016 the Gotthard Base Tunnel was opened. Combined with the fact the original Tremola road still exists, there are no shortages in ways to traverse these mountains.

The Gotthard tunnel suffered a tragedy in 2001, just two years after the Mont Blanc one when eleven people were killed in a lorry accident. 

Concealed deep within the mountain – and top secret until only a few years ago – lies a Swiss Army artillery fortification. Today it forms part of the Sasso San Gottardo Museum. An underground train, the Metro del Sasso, whisks you up to the fortifications.

The pass rose to prominence in the 13th century when the construction of the Devil’s Bridge made it possible to cross the wild Schöllenen Gorge below Andermatt. After the mule track was extended, the pass became one of the most significant Alpine crossings. Even today, the Gotthard, with its roads and railway tunnel, still constitutes arguably the most important north-south connection in both Switzerland and Europe.</p>

<h3>Tremola road</h3>

<p>The Tremola San Gottardo appears today as it was in 1951. The road is six to seven meters wide and flanked by supporting walls, some up to eight meters high with 37 hairpin bends. It preserves a part of the old dry-stone walls, a substantial part of the granite paving, as well as the stone markers. The two roadman's houses are no longer there. The first was located at the entrance to the Val Tremola and was demolished in 1989. The second one was located higher up the road, under Voltone. It was destroyed by an avalanche in 1874 and in view of the imminent opening of the Gotthard Railway Tunnel, in 1882, it was not rebuilt. The road leads over cobblestones to the south side of the Gotthard Pass. This spectacular road, with its hairpin bends snaking down to Airolo, constitutes Switzerland’s longest historic monument.</p>

<h2>Maloja Pass</h2>

<p>The gateway to St Moritz from Italy, the Maloja pass is famous for its last few hairpins but there is more to the road than the drive.</p>

<p>Rising from the Lombardy region of Italy the valley heads north to the town of Chiavanna before splitting into the Splugen pass and the Maloja pass. A popular route from Lake Como to St Moritz, the Maloja pass is open all year round with some delays for snow clearing. The pass is unusual in that nearly all of its altitude and corners are stacked in the final few kilometres.

Heading towards the pass from Lake Como the traffic is fierce in the summertime heat. All manner of vehicles battle to escape the lakeshore traffic and head into the cooler mountains. Even some horse riders appear on the carriageway at one point. By the time we reach the starting point of Chiavanna, traffic and temperatures have cooled. For a pass road the Maloja starts unusually - exiting the town on the SS37 it’s difficult to know when the town ends and the pass begins. The climb is so steady as not to notice it and the road is lined with endless buildings. The road gets thinner and the centre line disappears and the buildings get progressively older. Just when you think you have started another set of buildings appear.

All of a sudden we arrive at the Swiss border and things change. This is the Bregaglia valley in the canton of Graubünden and the old buildings are replaced with modern ones, the road improves and a shiny new roundabout holds it all together. It is obvious that we have arrived in Switzerland. We are straight into a half tunnel the Swiss love to keep the snow off and then the smooth roads with clean barriers and spotless walls to keep nature from ruining the road.

The mountains appear in front of us and the road progresses without much of a climb and barely a corner worthy of a pass road. As a diversion from the endless Swiss progression, we divert off onto the old road through the small town of Vicosoprano. It's a tiny single track road running through this quiet, quaint old village. At least it looks quiet - apparently, the crime rate in this Bregaglia municipality is 275% the cantonal average. It isn’t obvious what those crimes might be as we continue out of the village on an empty road surrounded by a river, pastures and a bucolic scene.

Rejoining the main pass road, the valley opens up and the road becomes even smoother and 80km/h feels like 30 on this motorway of tarmac. At this point, we wonder if this is even the right road, we haven’t climbed seemingly at all and the road seems to become straighter all the time. Finally a set of very loose ‘lacets’ appears and the road heads up into the forest. For a moment it feels it’s game on but before you know it we are back on the flat, straight again. 

It isn’t until exiting the final village of Casaccia that we arrive at those famous 12 hairpins that make the Maloja. We climb on a selection of tight, tighter and even tighter twists, some hanging out over precipitously over the valley. This is a serpentine piece of road, that climbs high quickly, really too quickly to appreciate. We attain the summit and everything changes.

The village of Maloja sits at the top and we are on the high plateau of the Engadin valley. Stopping to look back down the climb and it is just as impressive. With such a short climb it’s easy to ignore the beauty of the valley you came from. From Vicosoprano upwards the valley is stunning and it’s easy to ignore in your impatience to drive the 12 hairpins.

The road continues from Maloja to Silvaplana and onwards to St Mortiz. This plateau is dominated by the two large lakes of Silsersee and Silvaplanersee and of course the surrounding mountains that make up part of the ski area. There are plenty of opportunities to stop and enjoy this stunning plateau and the multitude of activities available on the lakes. A major watersports complex is one of the many facilities available here.

The road continues to sweep around the lakes on its way to St Moritz and it's easy to conclude that the Maloja pass is not one of the great passes. Certainly on the first visit the road is less than exciting until the final 5km. It is better appreciated once you know what to expect and enjoy the run up from Italy and its majestic views and deep green valley. Then enjoy the short but sweet hairpins before marvelling at the plateau and lakes. This pass is more than the final twists - consider the line from Bruce Lee in the Enter the Dragon -  “It's like a finger pointing away to the moon. Don’t concentrate on the finger or you will miss all of the heavenly glory”.</p>


<h2>Flüela Pass</h2>

<p>Linking the Alps' highest town of Davos with the Engadin valley, the Flüela pass was originally a trading route for one of Switzerland prized assets, salt.</p>

<p>The Flüela Pass connects Davos with Susch in the Engadin valley and ultimately St Moritz making it a popular route, so popular in fact that in 1999 a tunnel opened that transports people and cars from one valley to the other. There were plans to close the pass road once the tunnel was open but thankfully sense prevailed. 

The Flüela follows the path of many of the passes, used by settlers moving from one valley to another in the 13th century and then by traders bringing, amongst other things, salt into the region. Salt being very important in Switzerland - a state-controlled monopoly with only two companies producing it. Salt was important to Switzerland as it became the cure for the cretinism and goitres suffered by the valley people. The Alps, as with many mountain regions, don't have the required amount of iodine in the soil, so the Swiss started adding iodine to the salt. This practice continues today throughout the world as our soils lack the nutrients needed thanks to overproduction.

The pass road was first built in 1867 for horse-drawn post coaches and today the odd coach can still be found on the pass. Full of tourists, not letters. The pass road starts in Davos Dorf, the northern end of the Alps highest town, just past the Davosersee (Lake Davos) - a good starting point for the route. Davos is a large town for the Alps and has a wide range of accommodation and facilities. It’s a more functional place compared to some of the smarter resorts in Switzerland but none the worse for it.

Crossing the rail track, it's a short run through the outskirts of Davos before we are in the coniferous start of the climb. The first part of the road is walled to prevent the forest from incurring on the road, it’s surface one of the more variable of the Swiss passes and often patched up and covered in roadworks. Escaping the road works it’s not long until the trees disappear, Davos being at over 1500m, trees are only found on its lower slopes. The valley opens out and the climb twists and turns, not unlike the Grand Saint-Bernard but with a more panoramic view. 

The summit plateau isn’t long coming and we arrive at the Schottensee lake and a rough car park, which makes for a good first stop. Just past Schottensee is the Hotel Flüela Hospice, the official summit post and some better parking. Another lake, Schwarzsee ends the summit plateau. There isn’t a lot going on up here and it doesn’t have the historic significance we often find. Dominating the plateau are the Flüela Wisshorn and Flüela Schwarzhorn. On the far side we get our first look into the Engadin valley.

On the descent, there are a couple of spots where you can park and walk down to the Susasca river that runs down from the summit to Susch. The road follows the river and the valley narrows and we are soon back into the trees. This side is different from the climb, sinuous twists and a steady descent before the passes only hairpins, some of which are built out precipitously over the valley.

A final hairpin deposits us on the valley floor and the small village of Susch. Susch is the surprising home to a new contemporary art museum built on the site of a 12th century monastery, worth a look if only for its chutzpah. From Susch the choice is a stark binary decision brought to you by a T-junction. Head north to Austria or south to the glamorous resort of St Moritz.</p>


<h2>Bernina	 Pass</h2>

<p>Linking the high life of Switzerland with the Italian lakes, the Bernina pass is one of the few places in Switzerland you can see cars driven above the speed limit. If only for 2 days.</p>

<p>The Bernina Pass connects the famous resort town of St. Moritz in the Engadin valley with the Italian-speaking Val Poschiavo, which ends in the Italian town of Tirano in Valtellina. The pass lies a few kilometres east of Piz Bernina.

The Bernina Pass is crossed by road and rail, with a popular tourist train, the Bernina Express operating year-round between Chur and Tirano. The train crosses the pass west of the road at a slightly lower 2253m at Ospizio Bernina - it is the highest adhesion railway route in Europe.

The pass features three lakes Lago Bianco, Lej Nair and Lej Pitschen.

In autumn the pass closes for an unusual event for Switzerland - motorsport. The Bernina Gran Turismo is a hillclimb race for sports and racing cars built up to the early 1980s and takes starts from La Rösa, running up to the Bernina Hospiz in a 5.6km time trial. Switzerland rarely has any motorsport and no racing circuits and the Bernina Gran Turismo is one of only a handful of such closed road events. When theses events do take place they are usually based on historic or vintage cars, which is sad considering the Swiss have some of the best roads in Europe.</p>

<h2>Albula Pass</h2>

<p>Little known and narrow in width, the Albula makes the visit worth a trip for the Unesco World Heritage landscape.</p>

<p>The Albula pass is one of the lesser known mountain passes as it is surrounded by other better known alternatives. The Romans may have used this route to trade corn for beeswax but other more travelled routes took precedence even back then. The Albula is one of the less developed of the Swiss passes, in part it is now more than a singletrack and in Bergün it is still cobblestones.

In 1695 they first used gunpowder to create a tunnel and in 1866 the road was widened to 4m to let horse-drawn carriages and the post coach to get through. Other than tarmac the road has seen little further development, mostly thanks to the 1903 opening of the scenic railway line. The Rhätische Bahn railway runs parallel to the road and Albula river and is a popular tourist destination. In winter Bergün becomes home to one of Europe’s most scenic sled runs when the pass road closes to traffic and gets taken over by schussing wooden toboggans. Bobsleds now use the railway to get access to the pass road/toboggan run.

The Albula landscape is a site of Unesco World Heritage.</p>


<h2>Julier Pass</h2>

<p>The Julier Pass in the Albula Range of the Alps. It connects the Engadin valley with the rest of Graubünden. At its summit, the pass crosses the watershed / drainage divide between the basins of the Rivers Rhine and Danube. The Julier Pass lies between Piz Lagrev and Piz Julier.

Remains of a Roman temple and cart tracks were found and illustrate its importance in Roman times.

The road constructed in the 1820s to replace the old Septimer Pass was well built and is still easily passable after moderate widening for normal cars and trucks. In some parts, areas were rebuilt in 2009 to reduce the number of serpentine turns. </p>

<h2>Splügen Pass</h2>

<p>The Splügen Pass connects the Swiss Hinterrhein valley and town of Splügen with the Valle San Giacomo and the Italian town of Chiavenna. The pass is overlooked by Pizzo Tambo and the Surettahorn, on its western and eastern side respectively. On the Italian side of the pass is Montespluga, a small three street village which is cut off from both Italy and Switzerland during the winter.

Since the opening of the San Bernardino road tunnel in 1967, the pass like many others has lost its importance as a route and is closed during the winter. From 1818 to 1823 the modern road was built at the behest of the Austrian authorities, then ruling the Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia in Italy. In 1840, author Mary Shelley traveled through the pass on the way to Lake Como with her son. She describes the pass in her travel narrative, Rambles in Germany and Italy, published in 1844:

"A few years ago, there was no path except across this mountain, which being very exposed, and difficult even to danger, the Splugen was only traversed by shepherds and travellers of the country on mules or on foot. But now, a new and most marvellous road has been constructed - the mountain in question is, to the extent of several miles, cleft from the summit to the base, and a sheer precipice of 4000 feet rises on either side. The Rhine, swift and strong, but in width a span, flows in the narrow depth below. The road has been constructed on the face of the precipice, now cut into the side, now perforated through the living rock into galleries: it passes, at intervals, from one side of the ravine to the other, and bridges of a single arch span the chasm. The precipices indeed approach so near, in parts, that a fallen tree could not reach the river below, but lay wedged in mid-way. It may be imagined how singular and sublime this pass is, in its naked simplicity. After proceeding about a mile, you look back and see the country you had left, through the narrow opening of the gigantic crags, set like a painting in this cloud-reaching frame. It is giddy work to look down over the parapet that protects the road, and mark the arrowy rushing of the imprisoned river. Mid-way in the pass, the precipices approach so near that you might fancy that a strong man could leap across."

In 1843 the road was further expanded with a 312m long avalanche gallery designed by the Swiss engineer Richard La Nicca which today is out of use but largely preserved. Plans to build a railroad line across Splügen Pass were abandoned in favour of the Gotthard railway opened in 1882.

The Pass is also mentioned in Arthur Conan Doyle's "The Adventure of the Illustrious Client", a Sherlock Holmes short story of 1924. The Austrian Baron Adalbert Grüner, the villain of the story, murdered his wife by throwing her from the Pass, although Holmes cannot prove it.</p>

<h2>San Bernardino Pass</h2>

<p>San Bernardino Pass is a high mountain pass in the Swiss Alps connecting the Hinterrhein and the Mesolcina valleys between Thusis and Bellinzona. Located in the far eastern side of the Western Alps it is not to be confused with the Col du Grand Saint-Bernard and the Little St Bernard Pass. The top of the pass represents both the Italo-German language frontier and the watershed between the Po basin and the Rhine basin.

The route first became important as a mule track in the fifteenth century when the route between Thusis and Splügen was known as the Via Mala. A road for wheeled vehicles was opened in 1770; this road was significantly improved between 1821 and 1823, financed in part by the Kingdom of Sardinia, keen to improve a trade route connecting Genoa and Piedmont to the Graubünden that was not directly controlled by Austria.

Traffic flow was much facilitated when in 1967, the San Bernardino road tunnel was completed, since then vehicle traffic on the pass has been reduced, benefiting those taking the time to avoid the tunnel. The pass road is only open in summer.</p>

<h2>Umbrail	Pass</h2>

<p>The Umbrail Pass sits on the far side of Switzerland, the highest paved road in the country,  it starts in Val Mustair and ends at the Italian border. Just after the crossing is the start of Italy's famous Stelvio Pass.

The sign at the top of the pass gives its altitude as 2503m above sea level, but the reference level for Swiss altitude measurements has changed since the sign was erected, leaving 2501m as the correct value according to current methods.

The pass is named after the "Piz Umbrail", a nearby mountain peak.

The road has been entirely paved since 2015. The last unpaved section was a 1.5 km stretch on the Swiss side between altitudes 1883m and 2012m. During the 2017 Giro d'Italia, Umbrail Pass was reached during the stage from Rovetta to Bormio.</p>
