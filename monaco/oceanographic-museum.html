<h3>Oceanographic Museum of Monaco</h3>
<p>The museum sits on the west side of Le Rocher, the crown in the principality. Founded by Prince Albert I in 1906, it's well known for its association with legendary undersea explorer Jacques Cousteau, who was its director from 1957 to 1988. A stunning piece of architecture built from limestone originating from La Turbie in the mountains above Monaco, the museum took 11 years to complete and appears to rise from the sea, forming part of the cliffs. It sits in the Saint-Martin Gardens, offering beautiful views over the sea.
The museum often plays host to exhibitions by well-known artists, with two main floors of often-changing displays and a rooftop café. The basement is home to aquariums of different sizes housing a varied selection of marine life from jellyfish to small sharks.</p>
