		<p>Chamonix Mont Blanc, Chamonix, or CHX is a French commune situated below the largest peaks of the Alps and below its namesake Mont Blanc, 4,810m – the highest mountain in Western Europe. Chamonix sits in a corner of eastern France and is joined to Switzerland via the Col des Montets at the far end of the valley and to Italy through the Mont Blanc tunnel.</p>
		<p>Part of the Haute-Savoie department in France’s Rhône-Alpes region, it has a respected heritage as the premier site for mountain sports. Chamonix is well known to the mountaineering and skiing communities and it is where alpine climbing was born. Home to some 9,000 permanent residents, seasonal workers and tourists take this upwards of 100,000 people daily in high season. </p>

		<blockquote>The sign reads 'World Capital of Skiing and Alpinism' <br> - I call it the 'Death Sport Capital of the World'</blockquote>
		
		<p>There are many places in the Alps that offer an assortment of mountain sports, but none that have the breadth that the Chamonix terrain caters for. Chamonix is the crowned king of the steep couloir; it is an off-piste nirvana and the death-sport capital of the world. On the surface, Chamonix seems much the same as many of the ski towns across the Alps, but once you venture into the backcountry the picture changes. It’s easy to jump on a cable car or take a train that whisks you up to 2000m without breaking a sweat. From that point, things can get difficult quickly. </p>

		<p>In <a href="">Mark Twight's</a> 2001 book, <b>'Kiss or Kill'</b> he writes of Chamonix;</p>
		<p class="indent">In Chamonix men achieve great things, and the Nietzschean ethic of surpassing one's previous best efforts plays out every day. As with all geographic sites of power, young people make the pilgrimage to measure themselves against the place and its people. Some commune with the mountain god and find their true selves among the ice and the stone. Others get slapped down and end up in the ground. The cemeteries in Chamonix and Argentiere are beautiful. Rough-hewn monuments thrust through the earth like the mountains looming hungrily above them. They aren't homogeneous or polished like American tombstones or, for that matter, American lives. The carved stone speaks of great history.</p>
		<p>And later;</p>
		<p class="indent">In many visits to deceased friends I never realized how young most of the people lying beneath those stones were. Many of the interred were buried well before the end of their third decade. I met a grieving Swede whose daughter had been killed by an avalanche while skiing for Chamonix's other god, the camera. "In Sweden:' he said, "you rarely see a headstone for someone under 40. What kind of sick place is this?"</p> 

		<p>Skiing was first introduced in Chamonix at the end of the 19th century, and it blossomed with the support of the Club Alpin Français (CAF). In 1924 Chamonix hosted the first Winter Olympic Games. Le Tremplin Olympique du Mont ski jump can still be seen from the road when driving into Chamonix.</p>
		<p>Chamonix is one of the few alpine resorts where summer is as busy, if not busier than the winter. Day trippers are more common in summer as are the tourist buses. Many of the lifts are opening serving the multitude of hiking routes.</p>
		<p>From Chamonix the most beautiful route is via the ‘Route des Grandes Alpes’, a 700km long itinerary that officially starts on the south shore of Lac Leman (Lake Geneva). It traverses some of the highest and most beautiful and famous mountain passes in Europe, like the Turini, the Galibier and the Iseran. It ends with the Alps themselves at the French Riviera on the coastline of the Mediterranean sea.</p>
		<p>The capital of the Alpes-Maritimes and the French Riviera is Nice.</p>

		<h2>Aiguille du Midi</h2>
		<p>The Aiguille du Midi (3842m) is an iconic peak in the Mt Blanc range above Chamonix, France. It's the start for the famous Vallée Blanche ski run as well many climbs including Mt Blanc from the nearby Cosmiques Refuge.</p>
		<p>The journey begins from Chamonix centre. Joining the throng of alpinists, paragliders, skiers, snowboarders, hikers and of course tourists, you are crammed into the Téléphérique de l'Aiguille du Midi (cable car) to stage one, the Plan d'aiguille.
		The second cable car takes you to the top. If you want to achieve the highest altitude, take the lift to the top of the needle at 3842m</p>
		<p>The viewing platforms offer some of the finest views in the high Alps. Views into Switzerland and Italy and back into France.Exiting the Aiguille via the ice tunnel is not to be taken lightly. People are killed every year falling from the arête. Whether you are going to the Vallée Blanche or climbing a guide and suitable equipment are required.</p>
		<p>A truly breathtaking scene can be enjoyed from the viewing areas looking out to the Chamonix Aiguilles and into Switzerland while climbers and skiers descending the ridge to the Vallée Blanche and beyond.</p>
