		<p>Chamonix Mont Blanc, Chamonix, or CHX is a French commune situated below the largest peaks of the Alps and below its namesake Mont Blanc, 4,810m – the highest mountain in Western Europe. Chamonix sits in a corner of eastern France and is joined to Switzerland via the Col des Montets at the far end of the valley and to Italy through the Mont Blanc tunnel.</p>
		<p>Part of the Haute-Savoie department in France’s Rhône-Alpes region, it has a respected heritage as the premier site for mountain sports. Chamonix is well known to the mountaineering and skiing communities and it is where alpine climbing was born. Home to some 9,000 permanent residents, seasonal workers and tourists take this upwards of 100,000 people daily in high season. </p>

		<blockquote>The sign reads 'World Capital of Skiing and Alpinism' - I call it the 'Death Sport Capital of the World'</blockquote>
		
		<p>There are many places in the Alps that offer an assortment of mountain sports, but none that have the breadth that the Chamonix terrain caters for. Chamonix is the crowned king of the steep couloir; it is an off-piste nirvana and the death-sport capital of the world. On the surface, Chamonix seems much the same as many of the ski towns across the Alps, but once you venture into the backcountry the picture changes. It’s easy to jump on a cable car or take a train that whisks you up to 2000m without breaking a sweat. From that point, things can get difficult quickly. </p>

		<p>In <a href="">Mark Twight's</a> 2001 book, <b>'Kiss or Kill'</b> he writes of Chamonix;</p>
		<p class="indent">In Chamonix men achieve great things, and the Nietzschean ethic of surpassing one's previous best efforts plays out every day. As with all geographic sites of power, young people make the pilgrimage to measure themselves against the place and its people. Some commune with the mountain god and find their true selves among the ice and the stone. Others get slapped down and end up in the ground. The cemeteries in Chamonix and Argentiere are beautiful. Rough-hewn monuments thrust through the earth like the mountains looming hungrily above them. They aren't homogeneous or polished like American tombstones or, for that matter, American lives. The carved stone speaks of great history.</p>
		<p>And later;</p>
		<p class="indent">In many visits to deceased friends I never realized how young most of the people lying beneath those stones were. Many of the interred were buried well before the end of their third decade. I met a grieving Swede whose daughter had been killed by an avalanche while skiing for Chamonix's other god, the camera. "In Sweden:' he said, "you rarely see a headstone for someone under 40. What kind of sick place is this?"</p> 

		<p>Skiing was first introduced in Chamonix at the end of the 19th century, and it blossomed with the support of the Club Alpin Français (CAF). In 1924 Chamonix hosted the first Winter Olympic Games. Le Tremplin Olympique du Mont ski jump can still be seen from the road when driving into Chamonix.</p>
		<p>Chamonix is one of the few alpine resorts where summer is as busy, if not busier than the winter. Day trippers are more common in summer as are the tourist buses. Many of the lifts are opening serving the multitude of hiking routes.</p>
		<p>From Chamonix the most beautiful route is via the ‘Route des Grandes Alpes’, a 700km long itinerary that officially starts on the south shore of Lac Leman (Lake Geneva). It traverses some of the highest and most beautiful and famous mountain passes in Europe, like the Turini, the Galibier and the Iseran. It ends with the Alps themselves at the French Riviera on the coastline of the Mediterranean sea.</p>
		<p>The capital of the Alpes-Maritimes and the French Riviera is Nice.</p>

		<h2>Aiguille du Midi</h2>
		<p>The Aiguille du Midi (3842m) is an iconic peak in the Mt Blanc range above Chamonix, France. It's the start for the famous Vallée Blanche ski run as well many climbs including Mt Blanc from the nearby Cosmiques Refuge.</p>
		<p>The journey begins from Chamonix centre. Joining the throng of alpinists, paragliders, skiers, snowboarders, hikers and of course tourists, you are crammed into the Téléphérique de l'Aiguille du Midi (cable car) to stage one, the Plan d'aiguille.
		The second cable car takes you to the top. If you want to achieve the highest altitude, take the lift to the top of the needle at 3842m</p>
		<p>The viewing platforms offer some of the finest views in the high Alps. Views into Switzerland and Italy and back into France.Exiting the Aiguille via the ice tunnel is not to be taken lightly. People are killed every year falling from the arête. Whether you are going to the Vallée Blanche or climbing a guide and suitable equipment are required.</p>
		<p>A truly breathtaking scene can be enjoyed from the viewing areas looking out to the Chamonix Aiguilles and into Switzerland while climbers and skiers descending the ridge to the Vallée Blanche and beyond.</p>

		<h2>Montenvers</h2>
		<p>Departing from Chamonix centre, the rack-and-pinion railway takes around 20 minutes to deliver you to Montenvers at 1,913m. An imposing panorama of the Mer de Glace, the Drus and the Grandes Jorasses greet you as you alight the train. Mer de Glace drains the north side of Mont Blanc and at 12km long it’s the largest glacier in this part of the Alps. The ‘sea of ice’ label refers not only to its size but also to the coloured bands formed at its base.</p>

		<p>Montenvers represents all that is both good and bad about the Chamonix experience. An easy way for everyone to enjoy the magnificent views of nature’s best work; and a hellish, climate-changing mass of humanity and capitalism. Balenciaga- and Gucci-wearing Chinese tourists take selfies next to Italian alpinists climbing into their harnesses. Neither seems to notice the other.</p>
		<p>In 2010, landslides left 120 people stranded at the Montenvers and they all had to be rescued by the PGHM and Sécurité Civile helicopters. As with most of the ‘attractions’ in Chamonix, it’s easy to get to but also easy to forget where you’ve been deposited.</p>
		<p>A short walk away from the station and you will find a hotel, previously a refuge, and some smaller buildings – the Temple of Nature and a small museum. You can find a peaceful spot and admire the views towards the Dru and the Verte or across to the Aiguille Rouge. As we were sitting there once, enjoying a moment’s peace, a family led by two children appeared. One of the children announced, “Nothing round here,” and they turned and departed.</p>

		<p>From the train station, a cable car and 470 steps (100 more than in 2015, and 467 more than in 1998) take you down to the glacier and the man-made tunnel within it. Each year it becomes more inaccessible and each year more steps are added and the tunnel goes further into it. More people have been underneath this glacier than any other. It has long been time to stop – in fact it was probably time to stop when it took just three steps to get from the cable car to the glacier.</p>
		<p>Mary Shelley wrote in her diary that Mer de Glace ‘is the most desolate place in the world’, and in her most famous book Frankenstein appears there. Today the monster and the glacier seemed to have merged.</p>
		<p>The steps are not only a terrible blot on the landscape but a way to fool you into thinking it's easy to get there. An ageing French gentleman in white leather moccasins, his wife carrying a small, ugly dog, struggles for air two flights in. And this is on the way down. Men hammer away, reinforcing the crumbling infrastructure under our feet, and at the glacier others strap down massive white blankets to reflect light before it strikes the ice, to help slow the glacier's decline. But they won't stop it. The glacier is unrecognisable as ice and is lost under a thick layer of dust and rubble.</p>
		<p>The 'Ice Grotto' is an abomination with a blue carpet to help tourists stay upright and to keep their shoes dry while viewing photos of mountains stuck to its walls. A mock drinks bar carved out of ice that is hundreds of years old has Japanese women behind it, waving the peace sign at endless smartphones on sticks.</p>
		<p>During the ice age the glacier started at the valley floor; now it is predicted to lose a minimum of 1,200m by 2040. In the last 20 years, it has thinned by 70m. </p>
