	<h1>Crans Montana</h1>
	<h2>Valais, Switzerland</h2>
	<p>The two neighboring resorts of Crans and Montana are situated at an altitude of 1500 m on a sun-drenched plateau high above the Rhone Valley. Together they form one of the biggest holiday destinations in the Valais.</p>
	<p>These twin towns have much to offer, including an impressive view of the chain of mountain peaks from the Matterhorn to Mont Blanc and a particularly wide programme of activities all year round.</p>
	<p>Idyllic mountain village or alpine town? Crans-Montana embodies both and combines all the comforts of a modern holiday resort with an expansive natural landscape and panoramic views of the Valais Alps. The modern side of Crans-Montana offers the most extensive alpine shopping for miles around. It also boasts a renowned cultural and congress centre; and a wide range of accommodation. As a venue for major sporting events, and with a reputation as a golfing Mecca, Crans-Montana draws visitors from all over the world.</p>
	<p>Commune with nature in this family-friendly resort, where you can enjoy five swimming lakes; walks through aromatic mountain forests along an extensive network of footpaths; and cosy fondue evenings in rustic inns.</p>
	<h3>Winter</h3>
	<p>The ski slopes stretch from the high plateau up to the Plaine Morte Glacier at 3000 m. Directly beyond the edge of the forest the pistes are broad and open, ideal for beginners and deep-snow skiers. Advanced skiers will take the chairlift to La Toula to find a really challenging descent. Particularly popular are the broad carving pistes and the valley descent down the Piste Nationale which, at 12 km, is the longest in the region.</p>
	<p>In Winter the golf courses become a paradise for cross-country skiers and hikers. In addition to classic cross-country ski trails, there is also an extra piste especially for skaters.</p>
