        <p>Bellroy exists to slim your wallet. A simple message for what should be a simple product. I, like many others, carried a regular wallet around for as long as I can remember. It had spaces for many things, many things I never had. It also had space for paper money and coins. Once you put coins in it, it became too heavy. It had two clear plastic sections for something I never owned. I carried paper cash, driving licence, bank cards, credit cards, loyalty cards and the odd business card in it.</p>
        
        <p>Over time I stopped carrying cash and I stopped going to ATMs. All my purchases became card based either online or bricks and mortar. Business cards also seemed to disappear. So my wallet was 50% unused. Carrying it also required a large pocket and it was obvious to any thief in my back pocket.</p>

        <p>Then I discovered Bellroy. Bellroy have a selection of slim wallets, ideal for a card based lifestyle. I was keen to go as minimal as possible and as I spent a lot of time outdoors the Elements Sleeve seemed to be the solution.</p>
        
       
       <p>It's made from water-resistant leather, not that it's water resistant as such. It's just designed not to soak up water should your pocket leak or it gets splashed. It's made from a nice full-grain, vegetable tanned leather, that's made under environmental stewardship standards. It feels nice in your hand. Not like a leather bag or jacket, more functional, grippy, tactile.</p>
        
        <p>Operation is simple. A flap covers your main card. A pull-tab reveals the rest of your cards. Simply pull the tab and all your other cards are revealed. Press the cards back in to close the tab. It's a method I have only seen before used on phone cases and works very well. It also has a single key stash, which I haven't found a use for so far. You can carry up to 6 cards and it measures just 10cm x 7.4cm and is covered by a 3-year warranty.</p>
        
        <p>I haven't had a single issue with it. It slips into every pocket I have, front jeans being the most secure, and I don't even notice it. The only comment I could make is the flap for the main card could be a little easier to close. But that's being very picky. The Bellroy Essentials Sleeve is one of my essential items. </p>

        <p>Three years on from this review there's good news and bad. The good news is the wallet is still as good as the day I bought it. The bad news is Bellroy don't sell it anymore. You might still be able to pick one up online or Bellroy sell other card sleeves.</p>
