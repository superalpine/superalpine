<h1>Bond in the Alps</h1>
<p>In these articles we take a look at the how the Alps came to define the James Bond character, what impact they had on Ian Fleming and the locations used in the book and film series.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>James Bond was created in 1952 by the author Ian Fleming for the novel <i>Casino Royale</i>. Fleming was born in 1908 and was educated at Eton and Sandhurst in the UK before going to Austria to attend the Tennerhof School in Kitzb√ºhel, Munich University in Germany and the University of Geneva in Switzerland. This time spent in the Alps gave him a love for the mountains and made him an accomplished skier.</p>
<p>Fleming joined the Royal Navy shortly before the Second World War and worked for the Naval Intelligence Division (<span class="sc">nid</span>) where he had oversight of two intelligence units - 30 Assault Unit and T-Force. Fleming's time in <span class="sc">nid</span> was the inspiration for ten James Bond novels and a series of short stories. Two of his novels were made into films before Fleming died, aged 56.</p>

<h3>Books</h3>
<p>Ian Fleming wrote 13 novels and 9 short stories about James Bond</p>
<h3>Films</h3>
<p>To date there have been 25 James Bond films produced by EON films. Two other non EON films about Bond have also been made.</p>
