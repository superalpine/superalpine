<h3>A view to a Kill</h3>
<p>The pre-credits for the film are supposed to take place in the 'Siberia' teaser but most of the scenes take place in Iceland. The ski chase that follows was shot on the Swiss/Italian border on the Lower Scerscen glacier.</p>

<h3>The World is not enough</h3>
<p>In the Bond film The World is Not Enough, the skiing scenes were filmed in Chamonix.</p>

<h3>GoldenEye</h3>
<p>The Verzasca Dam near Locarno is used for the opening scene of GoldenEye sees Bond swan dive down the swooping, 720ft-high concrete face. The stunt took a week to prepare. A call sheet dated March 14 1995 demands a 70-ton crane to hold the bungee rope far enough away from the concrete face to prevent the stuntman smacking into it on his way down. Englishman Wayne Michaels did the stunt in one take. A local trekking company lets you recreate the bungee jump – but jumping parallel to the dam face instead of straight out in front.</p>
<p>Bond's race with Xenia Onatopp (Famke Janssen), supposedly in the hills above 'Monte Carlo', uses the mountain roads around Thorenc, about 20 miles north of Grasse, way to the northwest. Nevertheless, Bond arrives at the Casino de Monte Carlo, Place du Casino, Monte Carlo, and it's from the bay at Monte Carlo that Onatopp steals the Stealth helicopter. </p>

<h3>You Only Live Twice</h3>

<p>In Ian Fleming's penultimate James Bond novel, You Only Live Twice, he reveals that Bond was orphaned at the age of 11.
It's a rare look at the backstory of Bond and the Alps making a final appearance in the novels. James' father Andrew Bond was married to Monique Delacroix, a Swiss citizen, a storyline which was influenced by a romance Fleming had with Monique Panchaud de Bottens whilst studying in Geneva. Fleming goes on to describe the demise of his father and mother in a climbing accident in the Aiguilles Rouges on an unnamed route. </p>
<p>The Aiguilles Rouges is a mountain range on the north side of the Chamonix valley, partly designated as a nature reserve and mostly used for hiking. The Red Needles take their colour from the gneiss rocks that form them and are popular with rock climbers and boulderers, the popular routes are around Planpraz and Le Brévent. It's an unusual location to choose as most of the alpine climbing in the valley takes place on the south side of the valley on the Mont Blanc massif with many notable routes, many of which are the site of accidents.</p>


<h3>Quantum of Solace</h3>
<p>The film Quantum of Solace (the title comes from a Fleming short story) starts where Casino Royale ends with Bond taking Mr White to a secret site to be interrogated. The only location hitch is Bond has jumped a couple of hours from Lake Como to Lake Garda. A chase ensues with the DBS of Bond being chased by the Alfa Romeos of SPECTRE on the north of the lake outside of Malcesine through the many tunnels. At this point, we find ourselves in the making of the film. Sort of. We had been staying in Malcesine for a few days and on the morning of our departure, we left very early to avoid the busy lake road traffic. The road was suspiciously quiet and arriving at the first of the many tunnels around the lake, a Carabinieri patrol was blocking the entrance. We stopped as requested and after eyeing our numberplate he said 'Closed' nodding at the tunnel. 'Bomb' he said. He didn't look worried so we presumed it was some unexploded WWII ordinance, not unexpected in Europe. So we duly turned around and took the long trip back around the lake the opposite way. Some weeks later we saw the announcement they were filming a follow-up to Casino Royale with some shots of what was to become the opening scene of Quantum of Solace in the tunnels of Lake Garda. A lightbulb went on - it was 'Bond', not 'Bomb'. This made much more sense.
The Alps make another appearance later in the film when Bond is tailing Mr Greene to Bregenz in Austria and visits a performance of Philip Himmelmann's 2007 production of Tosca on Bregenz's spectacular floating stage on Lake Constance. Some of the driving and chase scenes were shot in nearby Feldkirch.</p>

<h3>SPECTRE</h3>
<p>In the film SPECTRE, Bond tracks Dr Madeleine Swann, played by Léa Seydoux, to the mountaintop Hoffler Klinik which in reality is the Ice Q restaurant at the summit of Gaislachkogl Mountain in Austria. Its temperature is kept at 1c to avoid tampering with its frosty foundation.</p> 
<p>The escape from the Klinik takes place on the mountains glacier road with a convoy of Land Rovers and a plane all involved in the snowy drama.</p>
<p>In an example of which came first, the restaurant and life station above Solden is now the location of one of the best experiences for Bond fans.</p>
<p>007 ELEMENTS is a cinematic installation that features interactive exhibits of the action sequences from SPECTRE, shot in the area. One of the heavily modified Land Rovers sits on the top of the peak. This particular one was bought from the film by Harry Metcalfe, the well-known motoring enthusiast and farmer. He made a video about visiting the resort that's available on Youtube. https://youtu.be/pIn7gCN6uC4</p>

<h3>Octopussy (Short story)</h3>
<p>Tiefenbrünner Hotel - Where Dexter-Smythe stays when working for MOB force. </p>
<p>Oberaurach Home town of Oberhauser</p>

<h3>The Spy Who Loved Me</h3>
<p>The ski chase scene in The Spy Who Loved Me culminates with Bond skiing off a cliff and opening his Union Flag parachute. 
The "set" is indicated as the Corvatsch cable car top station, but that was just a pickup point for helicopters ferrying crew to the glacier beyond, Blattler explains. He now leads tours in the area and suggests going to the top station of the neighbouring Diavolezza lift, which provides a panorama of the peaks that include the tallest in the eastern Alps – Piz Bernina, at 13,300ft. Most of the sequence was shot behind this range (the parachute jump was filmed in northern Canada). Bond somersaults and skis backwards to fire at his pursuers using a special ski pole, which I soon discover is among the props on display at 007 ELEMENTS. The challenge of making these films in ever-changing weather, on moving glaciers, becomes vividly apparent and explains the respect accorded to stunt actors and related crew who can deliver the right shot when the moment arrives. </p>

<h3>For your eyes only</h3>
<p>In the Roger Moore film For Your Eyes Only, Moore camps it up in the Italian resort of Cortina d'Ampezzo. Cortina in the dolomites gets a long scene from Bond arriving in his Lotus Espirit with skis on the roof to knocking over errant motorcyclists in the village centre to biathlon, a ski jump and a bobsleigh run in a seeming attempt to outdo OHMSS for winter sports. Cortina does well out of the film even if the snow was fairly poor and the crew had to bring some into the village.</p>

<h3>On Her Majesty's Secret Service</h3>
<p>In both Flemings' novel and the film, the Swiss Alps are featured quite heavily. The main action of both takes place at Piz Gloria, a name that originated in the novel as the mountain-top hideout of Ernst Stavro Blofeld. In the novel, Blofeld's lair is in the Languard range, above Pontresina in the Engadine region, where the Swiss language Romansh is spoken — piz is a Romansh term for a mountain peak. </p>
<p>In the film, the location was a partly constructed restaurant on the Schilthorn above Murren in the Bernese Oberland, where Romansh is not spoken. The movie production team found the restaurant and contributed financially to its completion in return for exclusive use in the movie. After filming was completed, the restaurant retained the Piz Gloria name and today still trades on the movie with a James Bond exhibition called 007 Walk of Fame.</p>
<p>Filming of the movie took place at various locations with much of it taking place around Grindelwald. OHMSS was filmed during spring and the snow coverage wasn't that great - the bobsleigh run - which was also built for the film, required ice blocks to be brought in to make the walls. The avalanche scene in the film was made up of two-staged avalanches, the first turned out to be not dramatic enough and was merged with a second along with some stock footage. The car chase where Blofeld's car was to spin off was filmed at Stecklebergand and needed five lorry loads of snow to be brought in.</p>
