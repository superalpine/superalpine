<p><i>Casino Royale</i> was the first James Bond novel written by Ian Fleming with what seems like an ideal location at the famous Monte-Carlo casino in Monaco. Neither the novel nor the film takes place there though, both making use of imaginary locations.</p>
<h4>Book</h4>
<p>In the novel Bond does make a mention of the Monte-Carlo casino.</p> 
<blockquote>(Bond) sat in the Casino in Monte Carlo for two months before the war watching that Roumanian teamwork their stuff with the invisible ink and the dark glasses. He and the Deuxi√©me bowled them out in the end and 007 turned in a million francs he had won at shemmy.</blockquote>
<p>Other than that there is no mention of the Alps in the book which is set mostly in one location - the fictional Royale-les-Eaux.</p>

<h4>Film</h4>
<p>In the first of the films to feature Daniel Craig as James Bond, we get a look at the Italian Alps and lakes. Our first view takes place when Bond heads to Lake Como to recover from an encounter with the villain, Le Chiffre. Bond relaxes in the grounds of the Villa Balbianello with a fine view of the lake. The villa may look familiar to film fans as it is featured (albeit with some CGI) in <i>Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones</i>.</p>
<p>The closing scene of Casino Royale takes place at Mr White's villa, where Bond takes White captive. The setting was Villa Gaeta on Lake Como with Monte Bregagno as a backdrop, which is also the start on the following film, <i>Quantum of Solace</i></p>
