        <h2>High above Saas Fee in the Swiss Alps</h2>

        <span itemprop="articleBody">
        <p>The Mittelallalin at 3456m is high above the Swiss Alpine village of Saas Fee. The Allalinhorn at 4027m is clearly visible above it and climbers can often be seen on its ridge.</p>
        
        <p>The ride up to the Mittelallain from Saas Fee takes two cable cars and a funicular, a peculiar mix of tram and subway where you stand on a tram that sits at an angle on the rail. </p>
        <p>Opened in 1984, it's the highest funicular in the world and being a fully underground railway, that also makes it the highest subway in the world.</p>
        
        <p>The Fee glacier is open for summer skiing and many of the top skiers can be seen training for winter. Saas Fee is one of those unusual resorts where you see skiers in summer. Up early before the ice starts to melt and then working on their tan in the afternoon.</p>
        <p>360-degree views are available, weather permitting and the revolving restaurant takes full advantage of them. It doesn't have the endless views of some of the other high lifts but if you are staying in Saas Fee at least the lift is free.</p>
