	<h1>The remarkable and tragic life of Jean Vuarnet</h1>
	<h2>Olympic ski champion Jean Vuarnet's success was overshadowed by tragedy when his wife & son died in a cult's mass suicide.</h2>
	<p>Jean Vuarnet was a French Alpine ski racer and the first man to win Olympic gold on metal rather than wooden skis. He later spearheaded the development of the first car-free ski resort in France and launched an eponymous line of sunglasses and other apparel. His wife and son became members of an apocalyptic cult that ended in tragedy in the mountains near Grenoble.</p>
	<p>Born in the Tunisian capital of Tunis in 1933, Jean Vuarnet grew up in the ski town of Morzine, part of France's Haute-Savoie region, but spent much of his youth in the cities of Grenoble and Annemasse. He learnt most of his ski technique during school holidays and had to supplement this by observing the top skiers at work. These observations saw him develop an aerodynamic stance and ski positioning which would later help him take gold at the Squaw Valley Olympics in 1960. After his victory, Jean married Edith Bonlieu, and upon his return was inundated with job offers, choosing to become the head of tourism for Morzine. He then partnered with a sunglasses manufacturer to launch Vuarnet, which after a slow start, found fame in the 80s with the likes of Mick Jagger wearing them. In a link to a later Bond in the Alps segment, Daniel Craig wears a pair of Vuarnet glacier sunglasses in the movie SPECTRE. </p>
	<p>While working for Morzine Tourism, Jean and Gerard Bremon developed a plan to build the resort of Avoriaz, high on the cliffs above Morzine. He also somehow found time to manage the Italian ski team for a while. Jean's busy life meant he'd spent little time with his family or raising his three boys; Pierre, Patrick and Alain. The only time the family spent together was during extended summer vacations. All this didn't slow Jean down though and the 1980s saw Jean start a book publishing company which by the 1990s had turned into a retail empire - Vuarnet International.</p>
	<p>Things took a turn in October 1994 when two journalists showed up at his door with news that his wife Edith and the youngest son Patrick, had joined an apocalyptic cult - the Order of the Solar Temple. The order was responsible for mass suicides in Switzerland and Canada, where the bodies of 53 members were found dead and partially burned. Inspired by the Knights Templar, the order was founded by an osteopath Luc Jourret and Joseph Di Mambro, a jeweller. Both died in the incidents.</p>
	<p>Jean spent the next year trying to persuade Edith and Patrick to leave the order but tragically, during Christmas 1995, the charred remains of 14 victims including Edith and Patrick were found in the forests of the Vercors. Investigators said a police officer, Jean-Pierre Lardanchet and Swiss architect Andr√© Friedli shot and arranged them in a star formation, before dousing the bodies with gasoline and setting them alight. They then killed themselves. Autopsies showed that most of the victims had taken sleep-inducing drugs. Despite a public outcry and civil lawsuits, Michel Tabachnik, a Swiss conductor thought to be the Order's leader at the time, was acquitted. </p>
	<p>Jean Vuarnet later married Christine who died of a heart attack in 2012. Jean died in 2017 aged 83. Michel Tabachnik maintains his innocence and continues his work as a musical conductor today.</p>
