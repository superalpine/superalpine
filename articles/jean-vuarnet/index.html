	<h1>The remarkable and tragic life of Jean Vuarnet</h1>
	<h2>Olympic ski champion Jean Vuarnet's success was overshadowed by tragedy when his wife & son died in a cult's mass suicide.</h2>
	<p>Jean Vuarnet was a French Alpine ski racer and the first man to win Olympic gold on metal skis, rather than wooden ones. He later spearheaded the development of the first car-free ski resort in France, and launched an eponymous line of sunglasses and other apparel. However, his wife and son became members of an apocalyptic cult that ended in tragedy in the mountains near Grenoble.</p>

	<p>Born in Tunis in 1933, Jean grew up in the ski town of Morzine, in France's Haute-Savoie region, but spent much of his youth in Grenoble and Annemasse. He learned most of his ski technique during school holidays and had to supplement this by observing the top skiers at work. These observations helped him develop an aerodynamic stance and ski positioning, which would later aid him in winning gold at the 1960 Squaw Valley Olympics. After his victory, he married Edith Bonlieu, and upon his return, was inundated with job offers. He chose to become the head of tourism for Morzine. He then partnered with a sunglasses manufacturer to launch Vuarnet, which, after a slow start, found fame in the 80s, with celebrities like Mick Jagger wearing them. In the James Bond film <em>SPECTRE</em>, Daniel Craig wears a pair of Vuarnet glacier sunglasses.</p>
	
	<p>While working for Morzine Tourism, Jean and Gerard Bremon developed a plan to build the resort of Avoriaz, high on the cliffs above Morzine. He also found time to manage the Italian ski team for a while. Jean's busy life meant he had spent little time with his family or raising his three boys, Pierre, Patrick, and Alain. The only time the family spent together was during extended summer vacations. Despite this, Jean continued to be successful in the 1980s, starting a book publishing company, which by the 1990s, had turned into a retail empire - Vuarnet International.</p>

	<p>In October 1994, two journalists showed up at Jean's door with the news that his wife Edith and youngest son, Patrick, had joined an apocalyptic cult called the <em>Order of the Solar Temple</em> <sup><a href="#F1">1</a></sup>. The order was responsible for mass suicides in Switzerland and Canada, where the bodies of 53 members were found dead and partially burned. The order was founded by an osteopath, Luc Jourret, and a jeweller, Joseph Di Mambro, both of whom died in the incidents.</p>

	<p>Jean spent the next year trying to persuade Edith and Patrick to leave the order, but tragically, during Christmas 1995, the charred remains of 14 victims, including Edith and Patrick, were found in the forests of the Vercors. A police officer, Jean-Pierre Lardanchet, and a Swiss architect, André Friedli, shot and arranged them in a star formation, before dousing the bodies with gasoline and setting them alight. They then killed themselves. Autopsies showed that most of the victims had taken sleep-inducing drugs. Despite a public outcry and civil lawsuits, Michel Tabachnik, a Swiss conductor thought to be the Order's leader at the time, was acquitted.</p>

	<p>Jean later remarried and lived until 2017, passing away at the age of 83. Michel Tabachnik maintains his innocence and continues his work as a musical conductor today.</p>

		<li id="F1">The Order of the Solar Temple traced its history to the revival of the Knights Templar in the years after the French Revolution. In 1805 Bernard-Raymond Fabré-Palaprat, claiming to be the head of the Knights Templar, attempted to re-create the order. His group split into many factions, some of which developed a belief in the imminent end of the world. Before founding the Solar Temple, Jouret had belonged to a descendant of one of these factions, the Renewed Order of the Temple.</li>
