<h1>Route des Grandes Alpes</h1>
<h2>From Lac Leman to the French Riviera, this route takes in the best scenery of the French Alps</h2>
<p>The Route des Grandes Alpes or <i>Great Alpine Road</i> is a 700-kilometre-long itinerary through the French Alps. Starting on the south shore of Lac Leman (Lake Geneva) at the northern tip of the Alps, it traverses some of the highest and most beautiful mountain passes in Europe - ending at the French Riviera on the coastline of the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
<p>The idea for a road through the Alps originated in 1909 when a member of the Touring Club of France, Léon Auscher was looking for a route from Evian to Nice taking in the most picturesque mountain passes and valleys. He described this route as the most beautiful mountain road in the world.</p>
<p>In the 1900s, the Alps were an isolated region of France with poor transport links from valley to valley, often only mule tracks. With its proximity to Italy, this new route was of strategic interest to the French State, so they financed the construction of many of the missing sections using the military on the most challenging parts and the Touring Club built numerous orientation tables and signage throughout its initial 615 kilometres.</p>
<p>In addition to the State and Touring Club, the <i>Compagnie des Chemins de fer de Paris à Lyon et à la Méditerranée</i>, often referred to as Paris-Lyon-Méditerranée and abbreviated to PLM, was also interested in the route. The PLM was an early French railway company that operated chiefly in the southeast of France and a north-south rail link between these valleys would have required the construction of many long and expensive tunnels for too little profit. In summer the PLM would operate coaches on the route, an easier and more profitable enterprise. </p>
<p>In 1911 with the route far from complete, the Touring Club de France organised a major promotional campaign for the 'Routes des Alpes' to which the press and various personalities of the time were invited. The PLM company set up a network of coaches from its stations and from July 1911 the first tourists took part in this planned route from Nice via the Col de Saint-Michel and the Col d'Allos to Thonon. At this time the Cayolle, Iseran and the Croix-de-Fer were still mule tracks. This didn't stop 15,000 passengers from boarding the coaches. The coach service was interrupted by the outbreak of World War I in 1914 and didn't resume until 1919 transporting around 25,000 tourists from Nice to Thonon, in six stages stopping at Barcelonnette, Briançon, Grenoble and Annecy.</p>
<p>During the war years, two routes were being explored: a Franco-Italian route connecting Thonon-les-Bains to Nice via the Col des Gets, Le Fayet, the Col du Bonhomme, Bourg-Saint-Maurice, the Col de l'Iseran, Lans-le-Bourg, the Col du Galibier, Briançon, Col de l'Izoard, Guillestre, Col de Vars, Barcelonette and the Col de la Cayolle.</p>
<p>The other option was an Italian Alpine road linking Le Bouveret (in Switzerland) to Genoa via Martigny, the Grand-Saint-Bernard pass, Aosta, Turin, Susa, Césane, Pignerol and Coni. Linking the roads would be the Col des Montets, Petit-Saint-Bernard, Mont-Cenis, Mont-Genèvre, the Lacroix Pass, the Larche Pass and the Col de Tende.</p>
<p>In 1920 the State classified the Route des Alpes (Nice to Thonon-les-Bains) as Route Nationale (RN) 202 and in 1934 the French Alpine troops were used to open three of the most inaccessible passes, the Col de la Cayolle, Col de l'Izoard and the Col de Vars.</p>
<p>The final pass on the route to be opened was the highest - the Col d'Iseran. At the summit of the pass, the depth of the snowdrifts was so great that it was undecided whether it would be better to dig a tunnel rather than clear them. </p>
<p>The Route des Alpes was inaugurated in 1937 by the last President of the Third French Republic, Albert François Lebrun.</p>
<p>On 1 January 1938, the PLM was nationalised becoming part of the Société Nationale des Chemins de fer Français (SNCF) and in 1939 World War II broke out. These events led to a downturn in customers and the opening of other routes across the Alps including the open all-year Route Napoléon meant the original Route des Alpes became less popular. In 1950 the route was renamed <i>Route des Grandes Alpes</i> as its strategic importance started to fade. In 1992, the Commission for Planning and Economic Development of the Alps relaunched the concept of the RDGA as a tourist itinerary.</p>
<p>Today the RDGA is open from June to September depending on the snow cover and is travelled by thousands of motorists, motorcyclists and cyclists. The Cayolle, Galibier pass and Iseran passes are affected by snow in late spring and autumn but remain clear in the high season.</p>
<p>The quickest route from the lake to the coast is now via the Autoroute but the Route des Grandes Alpes remains an important road linking the valleys of the French Alps. Whether you are driving or riding, the Route des Grandes Alpes is still the best way to see the variety of landscapes that make up the French Alps.</p>

	<h3>Léon Gustave Auscher</h3>
	<p>Born in Strasbourg on the 31st of May 1866 Léon was a French automotive engineer and writer, known for his promotion of tourism. His book Le Tourisme en Automobile, published in 1904 looked at the automobile, roads, maps, the hotel industry and what to see or do. A cyclist and later a car racer he joined the Touring Club of France after its creation in 1890 and became Vice-President from 1919 to 1939. He died on 11th August 1942 in Saint-Pierre-de-Chartreuse. </p>

	<h3>Touring Club de France</h3>
	<p>The Touring Club de France was founded on January 26th, 1890, in Neuilly-sur-Seine and created under the impetus of Paul de Vivie, by a group of passionate cyclists - their goal was the development of tourism.</p>
	<p>After starting with cycle tourism, the TCF opened to all forms of tourism, covering a wide range of activities and developed quickly to 700,000 members. It was important in the development of tourism in France before the creation of a state ministry. The association was wound up in 1983 following serious financial problems.</p>

<!--Thonon Les Bains to Les Gets
We start our journey in Thonon-Les-Bains, forever in the shadow of its well-known neighbour and bottled water capstone, Évian-Les-Bains, Thonon is a more down-to-earth town. Pretty in places, it's a lot more workmanlike than Évian with a lot of industrial development on its outskirts. The official start of the route is at the Hôtel de Ville and is marked by a kilometre zero plaque on the ground outside. In a typically French laissez-faire moment, the plaque marks Thonon as the starting point but Menton & Nice as the end. As if they were somehow connected, without another country in between. After paying homage to the official start we mark our departure on the shores of Lac Leman at the Port of Thonon.
Standing on the shoreline, Lac Leman stretches out in front of us with Switzerland in the hazy distance. You can almost hear the tinkle of Swiss watches being made on the distant hills of the Vallee de Joux, the watchmakers' valley. It's early so the bars and restaurants have only the odd espresso-sipping customer and other than the cars, the only noise is the clack and slap of the yachts in the harbour. Lac Leman is the largest body of water in Western Europe and with a length of 95 kilometres, it greatly exceeds all other alpine lakes. The lake is 62 metres higher than sea level and with a depth of 310 metres, it would make a good test for a Swiss dive watch.
To the south, we can see the snowy peaks of the Mont Blanc range, the highest mountains of the Alps. Fighting through the morning traffic we reach the start of the original Route Nationale 902, now downgraded to a Route Départementale, the road that forms the base layer of our journey. It's an inauspicious start on a roundabout surrounded by shops and businesses. Avoiding the ever-present horn of the French motorist we exit onto the D902 and head south for the next few days and 684 kilometres.
Following the course of the river Dranse, we are plunged almost immediately into the Vallée Verte, a verdant gorge with towering cliffs and trees penning us and the river in. La Dranse is used to wilfully scare tourists wanting the thrill of white water rafting. Numerous stopping places have old vans with trailers busting with canoes or dinghies and terrified orange and black-clad rafters in them. Joining them for what seems like a good idea at the time type of activity, we get to change into a sloppy wetsuit, exposing our whiter parts to passing traffic who respond with an appreciative blast of the horn. At least I think it was appreciation.
A smelly helmet and lifejacket and then you are in the boat. Instructions come thick and fast with lots of head nodding but it's of no use as it's all in French and at a pace with which we don't stand a chance. A call of 'Anglais?' received a look, a shrug of the shoulders and a seemingly serious and much-abbreviated instruction of 'Don't fall out'. 
We set forth into the froth and paddled when yelled at. We seemed to miss most of the rocks but somehow always got pointed into places where getting a soaking was unavoidable. Reflecting later, it appears to be a well-rehearsed act to soak the rafters to make it feel a bit more exciting than it was.
Back on the road and the gorge continues with enticing offers of devils and caves before the mountains appear and we are in Saint-Jean-d'Aulps, with the Aulps Abbey looking down on us. The church was partially destroyed in 1823 by locals for its stones, but the beautiful façade remains standing. 
It's not long after leaving Saint-Jean-d'Aulps that we are on the outskirts of the ski resort of Morzine. The D902 bypasses the main part of the village and you start to climb to Les Gets, but a quick diversion takes you to the centre and loops back to the Les Gets road.
Morzine is a well-known ski resort and part of the massive frontier-busting Portes du Soleil lift area that allows you to ski into five Swiss resorts and eight French ones. This is summer though and that means mountain biking. The same lifts work in the summer for the most part and you can traverse kilometres of trails without some of the longer climbs. This makes it a mecca for downhill bikes and Morzine has for years been the go-to place for downhill riding in Europe.
We head up the road to Les Gets, the bikes take the Pleney lift. If Morzine is the mecca for holidaying bikers it's Les Gets that has all the gold. Les Gets is infamous for its UCI World Cup downhill course that has seen some of the most exciting races in the series. One of the first places to hold UCI races in the 90s, the course has never been used outside of the series as a lot of it is owned privately by local farmers. You could sort of ride it if you dodged the electric fences and didn't get run over on the road crossing.
Les Gets has changed a lot since those early days. Now there are endless marked trails supported by the ski-lift network and queues of bikers waiting to head up or just hanging around the village. Some of the charm has certainly gone but with snow at this altitude often at a premium, the summer season will eventually become all they have.

Les Gets to La Clusaz
Leaving the village to its biking we descend the Col des Gets, another tight gorge full of twists and turns and gullies to catch those who can't stay in the lane. It's a fast-paced descent that twists back on itself before it opens out as the Giffre Valley appears below. We hit the valley floor at the pleasant town of Taninges where we pause at the river Giffre to fill our water bottles at the fountain. A brief climb to Chatillon and then the long swooping hairpins down to Cluses.
Cluses used to mark the spot where we exited the motorway after some 1,100 kilometres from the UK on one of many trips to the Portes du Soleil and some summers spent in Les Gets. It's a cosmopolitan place that always seemed to be hot and full of city folk after time spent in damp Les Gets. It was also the only place with a McDonalds for 50 kilometres. That was our idea of cosmopolitanism in the 90s and relief after two weeks of cheese and ham. It used to be a place for watch and clock making but nowadays the blind maker Somfy (if you have seen the advertising you are now humming the tune) is the big cheese in town. Otherwise, Cluses is like most other valley towns and a place you get a few things done you can't in the mountains. 
We cross the A40 motorway and pick up the D119, the D902 is having one of its time outs, and head up the Route de la Colombiere to its logical conclusion of the Col at 1,613 metres. Leaving Cluses we are immediately back climbing green valleys, similar but different to what we've done. The road is a bit tighter, and the chalets and villages are smaller and more spread out. The lack of ski slopes has stopped the overdevelopment. We break out of the trees occasionally until the final push when the road straightens and you can see the top. Rounding the final cliffed corner a chalet appears marking the top. The Colombiere is unusual in that once you hit the top you immediately start the descent. There is no plateau. They have still managed to fit in a restaurant, a cross and some awkward parking. 
We are in another valley now on the western side of the Chaine des Aravis and it's a combination of farming and skiing on the descent to Le Grand Bornand. Famous as a finish on 'Le Tour', its immediate attraction isn't that obvious, a bit sprawling and lacking a centre we move on a short way to La Clusaz.
La Clusaz like Les Gets has a bit of a biking history. Back in the 90s, they were the title sponsor of the Scott team, which was always a bit of a mystery as they didn't have much obvious biking and the lifts were closed in summer. Today they are fully invested in the summer season with all the usual activities on display. Like a lot of resorts that still rely heavily on skiing, if you arrive between the designated winter and summer dates you will find a ghost town and generally be disappointed at the patisserie. The sound of hammering or sawing can be heard and it's the time of year the trades can get in and 'improve' the place. 

La Clusaz to Bourg St Maurice
Leaving La Clusaz behind we head up Col des Aravis, which at the top is easily mistaken for Col de La Colombière, but with a plateau, a bar and farms.
Aravis is more of a looker though and up here amongst the mountains and pastures it's a classic northern alpine pass. Cows and grass right up to the edge of the narrow road with nothing but an electric fence between your wheels and the pasture. Trees are dotted around and the road is an endless ribbon, occasionally opening out before once again snaking its way down the valley.
At La Giettaz the valley closes in and you can see the impact water has on this part of the Alps. Everything is touched by its erosion, albeit slower on the rocks than the roads, rivers and trails. As is often the case we are following a river again as we plummet to Flumet and for a brief moment the D909 takes on the appearance of a classic Alpes-Maritimes road with rock walls to one side and a steep drop to the other. It's only the water running down the rock face and the endless green that give it away.
Flumet is a little village with an annoying one-way system and junction. Often the source of traffic jams and road digging. Must be the water again. We cross the busy D1212 taking traffic from Megeve to Albertville and head up the D128B, which splits at Notre Dame de Bellecombe. Confusingly both roads go our way to Les Saisies, neither offering more than the other.
Les Saisies is a sprawling ski town that attaches itself to either side of the road and doesn't want to give up. Chalets and businesses eventually peter out and the road endlessly splits and turns until we reach Beaufortain which feels more like a place people live than Les Saisies. Beaufortain is a pleasant little place with a classic French feel to it.
Leaving Beaufortain we say goodbye to the urbanisation of the Alps for a bit as the D925 takes us up and away through a mix of pasture and forest. A pleasant climb leads us to Lac de Roselend, our first body of water since leaving Lac Leman. Sitting at 1,553 metres and surrounded by nothing but mountains you couldn't get a more different setting. One side of the lake is dammed for hydroelectric generation with a 150-metre-high wall. 
Leaving the lake we are above the tree line and continue to climb through the alpine landscape. Rivers and snowy peaks surround us as we summit the Cormet de Roseland without fanfare and thankfully bars and shops. At 1,967 metres high, we are at our highest point so far and we leave the Beaufortain Valley behind us to enter La Tarentaise. The road descends 19 kilometres to Bourg St Maurice.

Bourg St Maurice to Modane

Modane to Briancon

Briancon to Vars

Vars to Isola

Isola to Sospel
Arriving at La Bollène-Vésubie, a seemingly sleepy village, we are at the start of a legendary stage in the Monte Carlo Rally - the Col de Turini.
The stage runs to Sospel and comprises 31 kilometres of demonic, twisting asphalt, taking in the 1,170-metre col. Often run in the dark, this crepuscular rally stage became known as the night of the long knives, getting its name from the lights of the cars cutting through the trees and slits in the walls as they hurtled up or down the pass.
The Monte Carlo Rally is a bit of a misnomer, nothing could be further from the principality's dense urban jungle than the rally stages, all run in France and some hours away from Monaco's millionaire seafront. The start and finish are both at Casino Square but it is more ceremonial. This is a bit odd considering they are happy to close half of the place for the other big car race.
We head up the M70 with classic maritime Alpine scenery on either side. Rock walls, steep drops, ravines and of course, twisty asphalt. Sooner than expected we are in the trees and then at the top. We take stock at the summit, peering into the Hôtel des Trois Vallées at the signed pictures of rally stars and old number plates, and nosing around the closed cafés. It's such a famous area, but devoid of the cheering crowds, snow and spinning of tyres it's just a wide bit of road with a couple of hotels. Not even a decent view to speak of. Everything is closed, and with only a Gitanes-smoking local hitting an old ski lift with a hammer – there is a very small ski area here – we decide to push on.
The descent to Sospel is different from the ascent from La Bollène-Vésubie, it's now the D2566 for a start and has trees and rock walls but it feels a bit lusher and the road surface is a bit worse. The village of Moulinet arrives and we wonder how the rally cars deal with the speed bumps. After leaving Moulinet the Notre-Dame de la Ménour chapel sits above the road. It's not the chapel that's impressive though it's the bridge to it. The chapel is only accessible from the 17th-century staircase which begins with a bridge over the road built in 1882. An impressive 42 metres and with 7-metre spans it dwarfs the tiny chapel at its end.
After the bridge, we enter the Gorges of Piaon and it's obvious why this Col is legendary. It never lets up and you wonder what it must be like to be driven at those speeds, let alone at night.
Back in the fifth century, Sospel was on the royal road from Nice to Turin, but it was bombed by the Germans during World War II to prevent contact between the French Resistance and the Italians, destroying much of the town. Some of the old town still exists, including the cathedral, but mostly the newer development dominates, adding little to its charm. The Bevera River runs through the centre of town and onward towards the coast.
Sospel is surrounded by great roads, though: the Col de Braus and its famous switchbacks, of course, the Turini and the Col de Brouis. Sospel also has an emerging mountain bike scene thanks to the Trans-Provence race that finished in 2019. The Trans-Provence is a week-long mountain bike enduro race from Sospel to the coast based on the long-abandoned trails that were once used for trade and defence. 
The village itself has a certain charm and a few shops and bars. Enough to stop for a break and enjoy the view down the river.

Sospel to Menton
Sospel may have lots of other great roads to explore but that will have to wait as we have the final stage of our rally to complete. We head south to the sea with a choice of two roads, the Route de Sospel or the Route de Menton. Both end up at a similar place but the Menton one uses a tunnel to escape the twisty valley.
After the tunnel, we arrive at our final pass, the Col de Castillon, a very minor pass in the great scheme that is the RDGA. After that, the Viaduc du Caramel comes into view, a tramline that closed in 1931 but stands proud of the road. It used to run from Menton to Sospel but as to its flavour, that remains a mystery.
The pace of urbanisation picks up and it's not long before we are on the outskirts of Menton, hypermarkets and football stadiums appear in the gaps left by the valley and then the mighty A8 appears on stilts in front of us. The run down to the sea is a rinse and repeat of traffic lights, and the rock walls and mountains of the valleys change to apartment blocks. We are hemmed in and even the view of the sea is blocked by the Casino. Finally, it appears and we negotiate the last right turn towards the port. We follow the seafront down, umbrellas flapping in the breeze on the sea wall. 
Locals are enjoying another long lazy meal and palm trees now sit against the azure blue sky. A surreal feeling from the open spaces of the alpine pastures. Beaches with sunbathers and swimmers replace hikers and sheep as we hunt for an elusive parking spot. 
We stop at the statue of Saint Michel at the end of the port and gaze into the sea. </p>
