	<h1>Oceanographic Museum of Monaco</h1>
	<p>The Oceanographic Museum sits proudly on the west side of Le Rocher, the crown in the principality. The museum was founded by in 1906 by Prince Albert I and is well known for its association with legendary undersea explorer Jacques Cousteau, who was its director from 1957 to 1988.</p>

	<p>A stunning piece of architecture built from limestone originating from La Turbie in the mountains above Monaco - it took eleven years to complete and appears to rise from the sea, forming part of the cliff itself. Its location in Saint-Martin Gardens only adds to its impressive nature.</p>
	<p>The two main floors of the museum host the displays which change regularly. On the rooftoop you can find a cafe as well as wonderful views of the Mediterranean Sea. The basement is home to aquariums of different sizes housing a varied selection of marine life from jellyfish to small sharks. The museum occasionally plays host to exhibitions from well-known artists.</p>
