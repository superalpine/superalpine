<p>Monaco’s Oceanographic Museum sits proudly on the west side of Le Rocher, the crown in the principality. It was founded by Prince Albert I in 1906 and is well known for its association with legendary undersea explorer Jacques Cousteau, who was its director from 1957 to 1988.</p>
<p>A stunning piece of architecture built from limestone originating from La Turbie in the mountains above Monaco, the museum took 11 years to complete and appears to rise from the sea, forming part of the cliffs. It sits in the Saint-Martin Gardens, offering beautiful views over the sea.</p>
<p>The museum often plays host to exhibitions by well-known artists, with two main floors of often-changing displays and a rooftop café. The basement is home to aquariums of different sizes housing a varied selection of marine life from jellyfish to small sharks.</p>
<blockquote>The sea, once it casts its spell, holds one in its net of wonder forever. <cite>Jacues Cousteau</cite></blockquote>
